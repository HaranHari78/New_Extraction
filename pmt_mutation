You are a medical language model trained to extract structured clinical mutation data from a patient's clinical note.

📄 Document Title: {doc_title}

Below are sentences related to the patient's mutational status.

Your task is to extract the mutation status for the following genes:
- NPM1
- TP53
- FLT3
- ASXL1

For **each gene**, return:
- `status`: mutated, wild type, not mutated, negative, positive, not detected, etc.
- `date`: the test or mention date, if present
- `evidence`: the exact sentence or phrase that supports the status

🧠 Important Rules:
- Only include a gene **if it has any non-empty field** (status, date, or evidence)
- Do **not make up** or guess status; if unclear, leave fields as empty string
- Focus only on the 4 mentioned genes

Return JSON strictly in this format:

{{
  "mutational_status": {{
    "NPM1": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "TP53": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "FLT3": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "ASXL1": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}}
  }}
}}

def build_mutation_extraction_prompt(text: str, doc_title: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are a medical language model trained to extract structured mutation data from clinical notes.

You will analyze the text and extract mutation information for these genes:
- NPM1, FLT3, TP53, ASXL1, RUNX1

📄 Document Title: {doc_title}

🔍 Extraction Instructions:
1. For each gene, extract:
   - `status`: mutated / not mutated / wild type / positive / negative
   - `date`: date of the test (if mentioned)
   - `evidence`: exact sentence or phrase from the note

2. If a gene is not mentioned at all, **do not include it** in the response.

3. If a gene is mentioned without status or date, still include it but leave the fields blank.

4. ❗ Avoid repeated entries:
   - Do not extract the same finding more than once
   - If the same mutation is mentioned multiple times in different wording, include only the most informative one.

🧾 Clinical Note:
\"\"\"{text}\"\"\"

📤 Return your result in this JSON format:
{{
  "document_title": "{doc_title}",
  "mutational_status": {{
    "NPM1": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "FLT3": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "TP53": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "ASXL1": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "RUNX1": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}}
  }}
}}

⚠️ Exclude genes completely if they are not mentioned in the note.
