ONCOLOGIST:  Janese Banks, MD at the Select Specialty Hospital - Tricities,  Cancer Center.   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year old with a history of  breast cancer, undergoing radiation currently, who presents to  Cardiology Clinic for evaluation of palpitations.  The patient states  that she has had some palpitations since she was 70 or 41 years old.  They have been sporadic over the years.  When she was in her 30s, she  had a Holter monitor that per her report was okay.  In September 2009,  she states she began having quite significant palpitations.  She went to  Fort Washington Hospital through the emergency department.  She  had an exercise treadmill test per her report that was normal.  There  were no abnormalities noted on EKG or on telemetry.  She was in the  hospital overnight.  The patient states that over the last 2-3 weeks,  she has had quite severe palpitations again.  They have been daily,  coming on for most of the day.  She states she will feel skipped beats  and also occasionally she will feel like her heart races.  She has never  had any episodes of syncope or lightheadedness.  She does not get chest  pain.  She does not get shortness of breath with exertion.  Ever since  she did chemotherapy earlier this year, she has been fatigued.  She  states the main problem with the palpitations is that they are  bothersome and can keep her from sleeping at night.  She does feel them  more if she lies on her left side at night.  As mentioned, she does get  the symptoms daily.   PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Breast cancer.  In September 2009, the patient had a  lumpectomy in      her right breast.  This showed stage I breast cancer.  She did have      adjuvant chemotherapy with Taxotere and Cytoxan and she is now      undergoing radiation.  2. History of colon cancer, this was stage III.  She had a colectomy      in December 2005 and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation.  3. History of palpitations as described above.  4. Papillary thyroid carcinoma.  This was in 2002.  The patient was      treated with thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine.  She is now      hypothyroid on Synthroid.  5. Appendectomy.  6. Cholecystectomy.  7. Hyperlipidemia.  8. Peripheral neuropathy secondary to oxaliplatin chemotherapy.   FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a family history of breast, liver, and  lung cancer.  Her brother had an MI, she believes in his 4s.  SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not smoke.  She does not drink any  alcohol.  She lives by herself in Zephyr.  She does have a boyfriend  who is involved.   REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All systems were reviewed and were negative except  as noted in the history of present illness.   MEDICATIONS:  1. Gabapentin.  2. Zocor 10 mg daily.  3. Protonix 40 mg daily.  4. Levoxyl 88 mcg daily.  5. Lexapro 20 mg daily.   LABORATORY DATA:  Most recent labs from April 2010, potassium was  normal, creatinine 0.95.  TSH was 0, however, the total T4 was 11.8,  which is normal.   EKG was reviewed showed normal sinus rhythm, is in normal EKG.   PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 117/79 and heart  rate is 72 and regular.  GENERAL:  This is a well-developed female in no apparent distress.  NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3.  Normal affect.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with normal respiratory  effort.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart regular S1 and S2.  No S3.  No S4.  There is no  murmur.  EXTREMITIES:  There is no peripheral edema.  There are 2+ posterior  tibial pulses bilaterally.  There  is no carotid bruit.  No clubbing or  cyanosis.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Normal bowel  sounds.  SKIN:  There is some erythema over her right breast consistent with  radiation changes.  NECK:  There is no JVD.  There is no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Normal exam.  HEENT:  Normal exam.   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 39 year old with a history of breast  cancer, colon cancer, and papillary thyroid carcinoma who has most  recently undergone chemotherapy  and radiation for breast cancer and  presents to Cardiology Clinic for evaluation of palpitations.  The  patient has had palpitations that sound long-term ever since she was a  child.  Workup has included a Holter monitor a number of years ago that  showed apparently no abnormalities.  She states the palpitations have  been coming on more frequently lately.  She has never had syncope or  presyncope.  Most recent TSH was 0.  However, the total T4 was normal.  Our plan will be to do a 48-hour Holter monitor to rule out any  significant arrhythmias.  I think most likely her palpitations  represents benign PACs or PVCs.  If they continued to be significantly  bothersome, we could try her on a low dose of beta-blocker to try to  decrease her symptoms.  We will also obtain an echocardiogram to assess  her LV function make sure her heart is structurally normal.  This is  especially relevant given her history of chemotherapy.  The patient will  see Dr. Lorin Picket tomorrow.  I will have her follow up with Dr. Lorin Picket  regarding her thyroid function tests.  It is  interesting that her TSH is 0, however, her T4 is within normal limits.  I think it might be a reasonable idea to repeat her free T4 and TSH to  see if that is accurate.

On presentation, he was found to have a WBC count of 43,300 with numerous monocytes and few myeloblasts on the differential. He was transferred to West Asc LLC due to concern for leukemia.     AML  He was COVID-19 and flu negative. Admission labs were notable for WBC 42.8 (ANC 7.4, monocytes 30.4), Hgb 10.2, Plts 61. LDH was elevated to 2093. CXR was normal. UA showed > 100 WBCs, with negative leukocyte esterase and nitrites. Blood and urine cultures were collected and are pending. He was started on cefepime empirically. Review of blood smear was concerning for the presence of immature cells consisting of myeloblasts, as well as numerous monocytes and some promyelocytes (see representative image below). He underwent bone marrow biopsy on 1/4 which showed AML with monocytic differentiation (73% blasts) and was subsequently started on aza/ven on 1/5. Prelim cytogenetic analysis is normal w/ molectular profile demonstrating:   DNMT3A R882C 44%  IDH1 R132G 41%   NPM1 Type A mutation 40%   NRAS G13R 40%  Patient will continue venetoclax as an outpatient w/ plans to repeat his BMBx on 1/28, which will help determine further therapy.     AKI  Creatinine was 1.4 on presentation, increased from 1.26 in 9/2020. He received a 500cc LR bolus in the ED and was placed on maintenance fluids. Creatinine was 1.57 the following morning and he received an additional liter of IV fluids. Cr improved with further fluids, however, did become elevated intermittently throughout hospitalization, again likely 2/2 volume status. At the time of discharge, Cr has normalized w/ improved PO hydration.     AF/Aflutter New as of early morning of 1/6. Patient c/o palpitations and was found to be in Afib w/ RVR, though has never been documented as more tachycardic than ~110. He was given fluids and started on metoprolol w/ some improvement initially. Then, overnight on 1/7, had episode of hypotension w/ Hrs in the 150s c/f instability requiring electrical cardioversion, however, patient improved w/ digoxin and amiodarone drip and was transferred to the ISCU. Patient was then taken off of amiodarone the morning of 1/7 given concerns for interactions w/ chemotherapy and was restarted on PO metoprolol with good improvements in heart rate. At the time of discharge, he is being continued on metoprolol 25mg  TID w/ recommendations to maintain good PO hydration.     Hypertension: takes ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide at home, which were held during hospitalization given AKI and soft Bps. At the time of discharge, these medications are still being held given low blood pressures."

Contraindications, Warnings, & Precautions   Contraindications: ? Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors at initiation and during ramp-up phase in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma due to the potential for increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome.   Warnings & Precautions:   ? Bone marrow suppression: Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia may occur. Neutropenic fever has been reported both with monotherapy and combination therapy.   ? Infection: Serious and fatal infections, including pneumonia and sepsis, have occurred.   ? Tumor lysis syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome including fatalities and renal failure requiring dialysis has occurred in patients with high tumor burden when treated with venetoclax.   ? Hepatic impairment: Dosage adjustment recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Monitor closely for toxicities.  ? Multiple myeloma: In patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, an increase in mortality was noted when venetoclax was added to bortezomib and dexamethasone. Venetoclax is not approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma.  ? Renal impairment: Patients with decreased renal function (CrCl <80 mL/minute) are at increased risk for TLS and may require more intensive TLS prophylaxis and monitoring during treatment initiation and dose escalation.  ? Immunizations: Live vaccinations should not be administered prior to, during, or after venetoclax treatment until B-cell recovery occurs. Vaccines may be less effective.  ? Reproductive Considerations: Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy test prior to therapy and use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 30 days after the final dose.  Based on the mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, venetoclax is expected to cause fetal harm if administered during pregnancy. ? Breastfeeding considerations: It is not known if venetoclax is present in breast milk. Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer.  Drug/Food Interactions     ? Medication list reviewed in Epic. The patient was instructed to inform the care team before taking any new medications or supplements. No drug interactions identified.   ? Avoid live vaccines. (venetoclax may diminish the therapeutic effects of live vaccines and enhance the toxic/adverse effects of live vaccines.  ? Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice. (may increase serum concentrations of venetoclax)  ? Avoid Seville oranges and star fruit. (May increase serum concentrations of venetoclax)    Storage, Handling Precautions, & Disposal   ? Store at room temperature in the original container (do not use a pillbox or store with other medications).   ? Caregivers helping administer medication should wear gloves and wash hands immediately after.    ? Keep the lid tightly closed. Keep out of the reach of children and pets.  ? Do not flush down a toilet or pour down a drain unless instructed to do so.  Check with your local police department or fire station about drug take-back programs in your area.

Course complicated by onset of AF/AFL with RVR associated with symptomatic awareness at starting 5 PM 1/6/2021.    Cardiology called overnight due to sustained poorly controlled rhythms with decreasing blood pressure    IMPRESSION - RECOMMENDATIONS:    New onset atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with RVR: No prior known history of this.  He was notably symptomatic at the onset of this rhythm but without any significantly uncontrolled symptoms at this time.  Denies any prior symptoms of this, suggestive that his arrhythmia is de novo.  Metoprolol was attempted for rate control but then met with lower blood pressures.  --Agree with initiation of IV amiodarone followed by infusion for short-term rate control, appreciate pharmacy assistance given concomitant chemotherapy  --Agree with digoxin 250 mcg IV x1 and monitor for response and consider full load, appreciate pharmacy assistance with loading and monitoring given concomitant amiodarone and chemotherapy  --Agree with volume resuscitation given lower blood pressures as he has noted very low p.o. intake as it should help with both his pressures and A. fib/a flutter rates  --Not AC due to thrombocytopenia Had extensive discussion with Dr. Reuben Likes and son at bedside regarding treatment options.  There is currently no acute indication for cardioversion.  Will attempt medical therapy upfront.  If there is poor control with medical therapy, discussed possible cardioversion.  This is likely new onset atrial fibrillation in the setting of his AML, and given this rhythm has not been sustained greater than 48 hours, would be reasonable to proceed without TEE.  Unfortunately, due to his significant thrombocytopenia he is not a candidate for anticoagulation at this time.  Discussed that risk of cardioversion include stroke, which is typically best mitigated by systemic anticoagulation.  Thus, cardioversion would carry risk of stroke, but would need to be weighed against benefits on symptoms and improvement in his hemodynamics.  --As above, would attempt medical therapy upfront, leave n.p.o. in the event of need for cardioversion    Thank you for this consult.

Briefly, Dr. Kestler is a 64 year old man with hypertension who was admitted on 1/2 with fatigue and malaise and unfortunately found to have AML. Started on chemo 1/5. He's been febrile and treated for neutropenic fever. He has had very minimal PO intake since admission.     He developed afib with RVR early morning of 1/6. Received one dose of metop 12.5 mg on afternoon of 1/6, not anticoagulated in setting of TCP. Rates were still elevated that night so he received 25 mg at 8pm. Around 11pm/midnight blood pressures dropped reportedly 70s/50s. Unclear if this was due to the higher dose of metoprolol, or if the BP cuff was not reading accurately in the setting of afib with RVR (rates in the 150s). Subsequent check was up to 100s/60s on the zoll without intervention. He was given 1L IVF, received 250 mcg of digoxin, and was loaded and continued on IV amio.    This morning his rates are varying but in the 110s-120s while I'm with him in the room. BP with MAPs in the mid 60s to upper 70s. Appears volume down on exam and by IVC assessment on ultrasound. Normal LV function. He is comfortable laying flat without shortness of breath. Unaware that he's in afib unless someone tells him.    Assessment: Dr. Reuben Likes has afib with RVR as well as intermittent typical atrial flutter. This is in the setting of a history of HTN but newly diagnosed AML along with fevers and dehydration. Luckily he is asymptomatic. BPs are soft but not dangerous at the moment. Rates occasionally jumping to 140s while on IV amio but overall stable in the 110s-120s. Often times we would cardiovert these newly diagnosed patients, however he cannot receive the 1 month of anticoagulation that's required after cardioversion d/t his thrombocytopenia. Pharmacy reports that amio interacts with his chemo with risk of TLS therefore will avoid this as well. Rate control limited by low BPs.    The best thing for Dr. Reuben Likes right now is to hydrate him and allow his afib to stay 120s-130s (on average) as long as he's asymptomatic. Agree with blood transfusion and 1L of IVF this morning. We can reassess his volume status once his echo is done this afternoon.    Plan:  -- Stop IV amiodarone  -- Continue to encourage PO intake and reassess need for more fluid later today (pro-BNP high in setting of afib RVR, otherwise dry)  -- If MAPs remain in the mid 70s, okay to start metop 12.5 q6h beginning this evening.  -- Hold anticoagulation in setting of thrombocytopenia      Thank you for this consult. This patient was seen and discussed with the consult attending, Dr Willa Rough.

Patient was largely asymptomatic (A/O and talking throughout), but was still prepped for cardioversion when BP improved back to typical baseline of SBPs in the 90s. Cardiology was consulted who confirmed that he was flipping between AF and Aflutter. He was given digoxin <MEASUREMENT> and started on an amiodarone load and moved to step down. Given these events, the patient is tired and somewhat frustrated this morning, but states that today is the best he has felt since presentation. He did have periods of rate control/NSR throughout the afternoon yesterday prior to overnight events and after starting metoprolol. Hgb acutely down to 6.3 this morning requiring transfusion.     Assessment/Plan:    Earvin Blazier is a 18 y.o. male with hypertension who presented to Redding Endoscopy Center with fatigue and fever and was found to have leukocytosis to 40,000 and diagnosed with AML via bone marrow biopsy.    #AML  Admission labs were notable forWBC 42.8 (ANC 7.4, monocytes 30.4), Hgb 10.2, Plts 61.LDH was elevated to 2093. Review of blood smear wasconcerning for the presence of immature cells consisting of myeloblasts, as well as numerous monocytes and some promyelocytes. S/p bone marrow biopsy on 1/4 which showed AML with monocytic differentiation (73% blasts). Since starting therapy, has become more neutropenic and will need viral and bacterial prophylaxis in the future.  - Initiated aza/ven for chemo starting 1/5  - PICC line placement today vs tomorrow  - Allopurinol 300 mg daily for TLS prophylaxis  - TLS labs twice daily  - start levaquin/valtrex prophy tomorrow    #Fever - Diarrhea  Suspect fever is driven by leukemia and is currently improving w/ treatment of his AML. CT chest rather unremarkable. GIPP/c diff negative. All other infectious w/u negative thus far - Continue cefepime for 7 days (1/1-1/7), repeat BCx NGTD  - will need to start PSA prophy after d/c of cefepime    #AKI  Cr bump again today, likely still related to hypovolemia and poor perfusion 2/2 AF/Aflutter.   - avoid nephrotoxic meds, including home hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril  - rate control as below  - daily BMP     #AF/Aflutter  New as of early morning of 1/6. Had episode of hypotension overnight c/f instability requiring electrical cardioversion, however, patient improved w/ digoxin and amiodarone drip. Remains now in Afib at this time, but Bps have returned to baseline and patient remains stable from an exam standpoint. Unfortunately, amiodarone interacts negatively w/ pt's chemotherapy plan therefore we would prefer to get him back on metoprolol or even digoxin if able.   - cardiology following, appreciate recs  - replete PRN to maintain K>4, mag >2    #Hypertension  Patient has been normotensive to hypotensive here with signs of dehydration, including pre-renal AKI.   - Hold home ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide as above     #Insomnia  - Melatonin 3mg  at bedtime prn   ___________________________________________________________________    Labs/Studies:  Labs and Studies from the last 24hrs per EMR and Reviewed    Objective:  General: Thin, pale, elderly man, sitting in chair comfortably, NAD  HEENT: Moist mucous membranes  Pulmonary: Respirations unlabored on room air.

Briefly, he is a 58 year old man with hypertension who was admitted on 1/2 with fatigue and malaise and unfortunately found to have AML. Started on chemo 1/5. He's been febrile and treated for neutropenic fever. Cardiology was consulted for assistance with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with RVR.    Prior recommendations were mainly centered around transfusing blood products and giving IVF/encouraging PO intake based on his hypovolemia on exam as well as his echo on Saturday (normal LV and RV function). He has been on metoprolol 25 mg q8h with overall controlled heart rates and stable BPs (MAPs upper 60s-low 80s).    Overnight patient was in atrial flutter with rates in the 150s-160s with activity. This morning he is in NSR with rates in the 80s. He feels well with no complaints.            Assessment:  It's very possible that he will go back into atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation based on his acute illness (newly diagnosed AML, anemia, hypovolemia), but at this point we recommend continuing the course and holding off on anti-arrhythmics at this time, especially given the fact that amio may interact with his chemo. Also would not recommend cardioversion since he is converting to sinus rhythm on his own (and could not be on anticoagulation with TCP). His increased HR with activity could be related to continued hypovolemia.    Recommendations:  - Would recommend continued monitoring of volume status and encouraging PO intake with IV fluids/blood products as needed. He still appears dry on exam today.  - Continue metoprolol 25 mg q8h (can be titrated to BID dosing near discharge, but would watch BP if team decides to increase the total daily dose).  - Would not recommend anti-arrhythmic therapy at this time - Would not recommend anticoagulation at this time in setting of thrombocytopenia    We are certainly available while patient remains here in the hospital. We will arrange follow up with his primary cardiologist, Dr. Zenaida Deed, shortly after discharge.    Thank you for this consult. This patient was seen and discussed with the consult attending, Dr Willa Rough.

Supportive Care Recommendations:  We recommend based on the patients underlying diagnosis and treatment history the following supportive care:    1. Antimicrobial prophylaxis:  AML (not in remission): Bacterial: Levofloxacin 500mg  PO daily (absolute neutrophils >/= 0.5 until absolute neutrophils >/= 0.5);   Fungal: AML fungal: None ;   Viral: Valacyclovir 500mg  PO daily (continuous) 2. Blood product support:  Leukoreduced blood products are required.  Irradiated blood products are preferred, but in case of urgent transfusion needs non-irradiated blood products may be used:     -  RBC transfusion threshold: transfuse 1 units for Hgb < 7 g/dL.  -  Platelet transfusion threshold: transfuse 1 unit of platelets for platelet count < 10, or for bleeding or need for invasive procedure.    Based on the patient's disease status and intensity of therapy, complete blood count with differential should be evaluated 2 times per week and used to guide transfusion support    3. Hematopoietic growth factor support: none    Hospital Course:   Hospital Course:     Kavion Mancinas is a 35yo man with hypertension who presented to Metropolitan Nashville General Hospital with a 1 week history of fatigue, myalgias, and generalized weakness as well as an episode of fever to 103. On presentation, he was found to have a WBC count of 43,300 with numerous monocytes and few myeloblasts on the differential. He was transferred to Centura Health-St Francis Medical Center due to concern for leukemia.     AML  He was COVID-19 and flu negative. Admission labs were notable for WBC 42.8 (ANC 7.4, monocytes 30.4), Hgb 10.2, Plts 61. LDH was elevated to 2093. CXR was normal. UA showed > 100 WBCs, with negative leukocyte esterase and nitrites. Blood and urine cultures were collected and are pending. He was started on cefepime empirically. Review of blood smear was concerning for the presence of immature cells consisting of myeloblasts, as well as numerous monocytes and some promyelocytes (see representative image below). He underwent bone  marrow biopsy on 1/4 which showed AML with monocytic differentiation (73% blasts) and was subsequently started on aza/ven on 1/5. Prelim cytogenetic analysis is normal w/ molectular profile demonstrating:   DNMT3A R882C 44%  IDH1 R132G 41%   NPM1 Type A mutation 40%   NRAS G13R 40% Patient will continue venetoclax as an outpatient w/ plans to repeat his BMBx on 1/28, which will help determine further therapy.     AKI  Creatinine was 1.4 on presentation, increased from 1.26 in 9/2020. He received a 500cc LR bolus in the ED and was placed on maintenance fluids. Creatinine was 1.57 the following morning and he received an additional liter of IV fluids. Cr improved with further fluids, however, did become elevated intermittently throughout hospitalization, again likely 2/2 volume status. At the time of discharge, Cr has normalized w/ improved PO hydration.     AF/Aflutter  New as of early morning of 1/6. Patient c/o palpitations and was found to be in Afib w/ RVR, though has never been documented as more tachycardic than ~110. He was given fluids and started on metoprolol w/ some improvement initially. Then, overnight on 1/7, had episode of hypotension w/ Hrs in the 150s c/f instability requiring electrical cardioversion, however, patient improved w/ digoxin and amiodarone drip and was transferred to the ISCU. Patient was then taken off of amiodarone the morning of 1/7 given concerns for interactions w/ chemotherapy and was restarted on PO metoprolol with good improvements in heart rate. At the time of discharge, he is being continued on metoprolol 25mg  TID w/ recommendations to maintain good PO hydration.     Hypertension: takes ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide at home, which were held during hospitalization given AKI and soft Bps. At the time of discharge, these medications are still being held given low blood pressures.

Staff Referring Physician:     SELF, REFERRED  ; Sonographer:     Aida Raider, RDCS Ordering Physician:     Mart Piggs Account #:     192837465738 Summary   1. The left ventricle is normal in size with normal wall thickness.   2. The left ventricular systolic function is normal, LVEF is visually estimated at > 55%.   3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with normal leaflet mobility.   4. There is mild mitral valve regurgitation.   5. The right ventricle is normal in size, with normal systolic function. Left Ventricle   The left ventricle is normal in size with normal wall thickness.   The left ventricular systolic function is normal, LVEF is visually estimated at > 55%.   There is normal left ventricular diastolic function. Right Ventricle   The right ventricle is normal in size, with normal systolic function. Left Atrium   The left atrium is normal in size. Right Atrium   The right atrium is normal  in size. Aortic Valve   The aortic valve is trileaflet with normal appearing leaflets with normal excursion.   There is no significant aortic regurgitation.   There is no evidence of a significant transvalvular gradient. Pulmonic Valve   The pulmonic valve is poorly visualized, but probably normal.   There is no significant pulmonic regurgitation.   There is no evidence of a significant transvalvular gradient. Mitral Valve   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with normal leaflet mobility.   There is mild mitral valve regurgitation. Tricuspid Valve   The tricuspid valve leaflets are normal, with normal leaflet mobility.   There is trivial tricuspid regurgitation.   Pulmonary systolic pressure cannot be estimated due to insufficient TR jet. Pericardium/Pleural   There is no pericardial effusion. Inferior Vena Cava   IVC size and inspiratory change suggest normal right atrial pressure. (0-5 mmHg). Aorta   The aorta is normal in size in the visualized segments.

As I have mentioned, just listen to your body. It may take some time for you to regain all of your prior strength back, but I do believe you will return to your prior functional baseline. If you feel tired or fatigued, I recommend you be mindful of what your body is telling you and that it's also OK to rest and take things slow, but I have no concerns about you continuing to do regular things like walk the stairs, walk around the house, use the restroom when you need to, or other activities.

[ ]  During hospital stay, pt received a total of 1,170 mg PO equivalents of amiodarone after an episode of Afib with RVR. Given DDI with venetoclax with amiodarone, the ramp-up was paused to account (1/5 100mg , 1/6 200mg , 1/7 200mg , 1/8 200mg , 1/9+ 400mg ). After discontinuation of amiodarone, venetoclax was re-started at 400mg  once daily. Patient has since been rate controlled on metoprolol 25mg  TID. Anticoagulation for Afib was deferred given anticipated prolonged thrombocytopenia.    Nada Boozer, PharmD  Clinical Pharmacist    Ardyth Harps.

He is doing well on treatment and is currently not experiencing any side effects.     Educated patient on side effects of regimen including myelosuppression, injection site pain, fatigue, n/v, diarrhea, and infection risk. Discussed importance of taking venetoclax with food and indication for levaquin and valtrex use. Additionally, discussed overall plan with medication to get BMBx and assess response after first cycle. Based on response, will continue venetoclax or hold for count recovery. Educated patient on what response meant and that next cycle may consist of aza x7 days and venetoclax x28 days but dose changes would be based on his blood levels and recovery.     Plan:   - Continue venetoclax 400 mg daily with food until told otherwise- Discussed if were to run out how to contact clinic to get new script sent to Othello Community Hospital and number to refill medications at Portland Clinic. Needs refills, but will wait to see if BMbx results dictate holding drug and a lower dose upon recovery  - BMBx 1/28/21 to assess response to therapy  - Continue valtrex and levaquin for prophylaxis - only received 30 day supply at discharge and will need refill on follow-up on 2/4  - Start ondansetron 4 mg q8h prn - Sent script to CVS so patient has on hand  - Consider posaconazole with ANC <0.5 for fungal prophylaxis.

Encounter Date: 1/14/2021      Primary Care Provider:  Eulogio Bear, MD    Referring Physician:  Referred Self    Reason for visit:  Transitions of care visit    Assessment:  Mr. Cam Dauphin is a  65 y.o. male with newly diagnosed AMLA s/p aza/ven induction, who is seen in clinic following inpatient discharge for coordination of transition of care.      Mr. Klippel is doing well after discharge.  He did not require transfusion today.  He is taking his meds appropriately.  We discussed that treatment with aza/ven is indefinite, as we cannot cure his AML.  Reviewed the treatment plan - 7 days of aza, along with 28 days of venetoclax.  Dose reductions would come with toxicities, including myelosuppression or other side effects.      Reviewed that he should continue the metoprolol unless his BP were to increase.  Suggest follow up with PCP.    Plan and Recommendations:  1. AML  - continue venetoclax as directed  - labs and transfusions twice weekly  - PICC line dressing change weekly - done today in clinic  - reorder home health for line care  - continue antibiotic PPX for ANC 0.0  - BMBx scheduled for 1/28 after completion of cycle 1    2.

M with AML on azacitidine + venetoclax. C1D1 1/5. Patient of Dr. Zenaida Niece Deventer's. Had diarrhea and now with constipation. It has been several days since he had a good bowel movement so he used a glycerin suppository last night. Has had terrible rectal pain with some fecal dribbling after taking the suppository. He had a few chunks of stool produced but generally just dribbles of liquid stool. He has not tried any po bowel regimen. Is also having some urinary hesitancy.  If sits for another 15 minutes, is able to urinate. If presses on the perineal area, feels better. He does feel an induration or evidence of abscess. He thinks it is probably a local irritation. Started after dinner last night when he decided to use the suppository. Between 9 pm and now, 5 episodes of the pain, seems to be occurring less frequently now. Feels like a spasm or burning. Maybe can feel some external hemorrhoids- he has a history of constipation in the past. When he presses on his perineum, the pressure is somewhat relieved.    Patient's questions: 1) Does he need to be evaluated today? He would prefer to avoid ED. 2) What can he do to relieve the pain and discomfort.     I told the patient that his description of relieving pressure when he presses on the perineum makes me think that he likely has some retained, impacted stool. Given his ANC 0 and platelets 15K, do not recommend anything further per rectum like enemas or suppositories. I told him to start taking 1-2 capfuls of miralax, 3 times a day, titrating to efficacy.Also discussed adjuncts such as docusate, senna and mag citrate, if none of these methods are successful. He will start with miralax.  I also told him he can try Preparation H or a barrier cream for the mucosal irritation. Lastly, I discussed scenarios in which he needs to present to ED: 1)  Any temp >= 100.5 given his ANC 0, 2) worsening pain - currently he says it is improving.     He will be seen in infusion clinic for labs and possible transfusion tomorrow. I said if his pain continues to improve and no fever, he can wait and be evaluated tomorrow.     Assessment/Plan:   -- miralax 1 capful tid for constipation  -- no enemas or suppositories per rectum  -- Preparation H for possible hemorrhoids / mucosal irritation  -- ED if temp >= 100.5 or worsening pain      Please page Med E Fellow at 9211941 if patient needs admission or presents to ED.

M with hx of AML here with complaints of urinary retention, constipation and rectal pain and discomfort for the last several days. States started after placing a suppository with the feeling of rectal discomfort and distension. + rectal spasming. Now with significant urinary retention over the last day.  Bedside ultrasound with greater than 900 cc of urine challenge.  Patient will need Foley catheter placement.  Patient with noted concern and hesitancy with regards to his neutropenic status.  Have asked that I consult hematology/oncology prior to placement.  I do believe that this is a sterile procedure and the report safe in the setting, however I will send a page out to oncology for their advice.  In the meantime, patient has obtained labs earlier today in clinic.  Will not repeat here.  His anterior abdomen is soft but he does have significant discomfort in his perineum.  Reassess once Foley catheter is placed.  Of note, pt without complaints of fevers/chills. No chest pain or shortness of breath. No need for cultures at this time unless heme/oncology desires. I have discussed with hematology fellow who is in agreement that patient is safe for Foley catheter placement.  We have placed the catheter with over 1000 cc out initially.  He is feeling much improved.  He still has rectal discomfort.  On my exam, he is noted to have 1 small external hemorrhoid that is nonthrombosed and nontender.  He has no perirectal induration but he does have significant discomfort with reports of rectal spasms after any kind of palpation or maneuvering.  His anterior abdomen is soft.  Given his persistent discomfort, will plan to obtain imaging to assess for possible colitis versus steroid colitis versus proctitis. Pt also noted to have hemoglobin of 8.3, there was a concern for possible need for transfusion. Give hemoglobin >8, stable from previous of 8.6, will hold off on transfusion at this time.     Pt with noted concerns for sterocoral colitis on CT scan 2/2 large fecal impaction. Given patient with significant neutropenia, I  am hesitant to perform a fecal disimpaction at this time.  In addition, after review of scans, I believe the fecal ball is too large for digital disimpaction here.  I discussed the case with oncology fellow on-call who is in agreement patient would benefit from an admission for further cleanout and possible manual disimpaction/procedure for clearance.  Given concern of development of possible ischemia versus infection versus ulceration, patient will need to be closely monitor.  He is afebrile currently.  I have discussed with heme-onc fellow, no indication for antibiotics at this time. Will continue to monitor closely.  MAO paged.  Asymptomatic Covid swab order placed.  Patient signed out incoming team pending admission.       Additional Medical Decision Making I have reviewed the vital signs and the nursing notes. Labs and radiology results that were available during my care of the patient were independently reviewed by me and considered in my medical decision making.       I independently visualized the radiology images.   I reviewed the patient's prior medical records  I discussed the  case with the heme/oncology consultant.   I discussed the case and plan for continuity of care with the admitting provider.     Portions of this record have been created using Scientist, clinical (histocompatibility and immunogenetics). Dictation errors have been sought, but  not have been identified and corrected.  ____________________________________________         History        Chief Complaint  Urinary Retention      HPI   Rory Xiang is a 56 y.o. male with hx of AML undergoing active chemo of azacitidine + venetoclax.

Principal Problem:    Urinary retention  Active Problems:    Leukemia (CMS-HCC)    Acute myeloid leukemia not having achieved remission (CMS-HCC)    Constipation    Colitis  Resolved Problems:    * No resolved hospital problems. *      Constipation c/b sterocoral colitis: pt has not had a normal BM in several days, but instead has had intermittent episodes of diarrhea and constipation. He began feeling worsening abd pressure and urinary hesitancy starting about two days ago, that was unrelieved by suppositories and miralax. Patient presents today in the setting of worsening urinary retention, likely 2/2 underlying constipation and stool ball. VSS, but CTAP w/ stool ball measuring almost 8cm and evidence of stercoral colitis. Unfortunately, the patient has an ANC of 0.1%, therefore it is high risk to disimpact him. At this time, his colitis appears mild to moderate on imaging and his lactate is reassuring. We will plan to manage conservatively for a short period of time with an additional plan to pursue manual disimpaction tomorrow or consult GI if no improvement.   - cef/flagyl for antibiotic treatment  - start golytely prep for conservative management, low threshold to trial manual disimpaction tomorrow or sooner if no improvement in stools or worsening rectal pain or discomfort  - low threshold to consult GI if clinically worsens  - maintenance fluids for now  - will transfuse platelets to > 50k for now in anticipation of possible procedure tomorrow    Urinary Retention: 2/2 underlying constipation and stool ball. Had progressive urinary hesitancy for the past 48 hours until today when he suddenly began retaining completely. Foley inserted in the ED w/ ~1L UOP immediately. UA reassuring  - maintain foley for now, will discontinue once constipation resolves  - strict I/Os    Hyperbilirubinemia: newly elevated Tbili to 2.8 today compared to previously normal bilirubins. Likely related to current acute illness or medications, though it is unusual to have an isolated mildly elevated bilirubin and no LFTs. Suspect that ultimately this is either erroneous or self-limiting.  - direct bili, LDH, haptoglobin now  - trend LFTs  - avoid hepatotoxic meds    AML: recently diagnosed earlier this month after he presented w/ fatigue, myalgias, malaise and fevers. Admission labs were notable forWBC 42.8 (ANC 7.4, monocytes 30.4), Hgb 10.2, Plts 61.LDH was elevated to 2093. BMBx on 1/4 showed AML with monocytic differentiation (73% blasts) and he was subsequently started on aza/ven on 1/5. Prelim cytogenetic analysis is normal w/ molectular profile demonstrating DNMT3A R882C 44%, IDH1 R132G 41%, NPM1 Type A mutation 40%, NRAS G13R 40%. Patient has continued to follow w/ Dr. Leotis Pain and has otherwise been doing well.   - will need repeat BMBx on 1/28  - daily CBC w/ diff  - transfuse to maintain hgb > 7, plt > 50k (for tonight in case he needs to be disimpacted/scoped tomorrow)  - neutropenic precautions  - cont valtrex prophylaxis, holding home levaquin while on cefepime  - holding home venetoclax for now, may resume tomorrow vs Wednesday if he is clinically improving    Afib: new during his last  Hospitalization and most likely related to volume status as he was quite volume down at  the time. He has since been well controlled on home metoprolol  - cont metop 25mg  TID    Daily Checklist:  Diet: Clear Liquid Diet and Regular Diet  DVT PPx: Contradindicated - Thrombocytopenic   GI PPx: Not Indicated  Code Status: Full Code  Dispo: Admit to E1, floor status    Chief Concern:   Urinary retention    Subjective:   HPI:  Smiley Birr is a 22 y.o. male with PMHx of newly diagnosed AML started on aza/ven who presents today w/ increasing abdominal pain and retention. Patient was discharged from E1 on 1/12 after his first cycle of aza/ven. Since then, he has presented to all of his scheduled oncology appointments and had generally been doing well until two days ago when he began having alternating episodes of diarrhea and constipation. He tried suppositories at home w/o any significant improvement in his symptoms and called the on-call fellow for further advice. At the time, he noted some urinary hesitancy that was relieved by waiting for 10-15 minutes to use the restroom. He also described some intermittent episodes of rectal pain that was alleviated by pressing on his perineum. During this phone with Dr. Starr Sinclair, she recommended no further enemas or suppositories given his ANC 0, and rather that he rely on miralax TID. Patient attempted these and had a very small, hard BM but unfortunately began experiencing urinary retention today. At this time, he remains uncomfortable and continues to c/o ongoing rectal pain. He denies any fevers, chills, CP, SOB, palpitations, abd pain, n/v, changes in diet, dysuria, hematuria, LE edema.     In the ED, VSS. Labs demonstrate WBC 0.5, hgb 8.3, plt 14, ANC 0.1, sodium 133, T bili 2.8. CTAP demonstrates large rectal stool ball measuring 7.8cm w/ adjacent soft tissue stranding of the distal sigmoid colon through the rectum c/w stercoral colitis. Foley placed w/ >1L UOP.

M with recent Dx of favorable risk AML initiated on Venetoclax, admitted on 1/12/21 after developing fecal impaction which resolved after administration of go-lytely. Pt reports that he had previously been on ACE-I and Thiazide diuretic for control of BP. These were stopped after toprol was initiation in the setting of pAfib. He has since noted an increase in BP to 140/80 and has developed some pedal edema in bilateral feet. Denies orthopnea but may be a little more dyspneic on exertion. He is not passing any significant stool but is passing gas and has adequate UOP.    We discussed that the fact that he is off his prior BP meds may explain his increase back to baseline Bps prior to treatment. Toprol is a better rate control agent than anti-hypertensive. He may also be having some edema after stopping hydrochlorothiazide in conjunction with starting Venetoclax which causes edema in 22% of patients.    Pt can continue to monitor for progression of edema, SOB, BP at home and call back if there are any significant changes.    Assessment/Plan:   See above      Please page Med E Fellow at 9416508 if patient needs admission or questions about care occur.     Fellow Taking Call:  Jill Alexanders  January 23, 2021 10:10 PM"

We discuss that sometimes there can be some irritation at the site from different cleaning products, but that this could also represent the early signs of infection. We decided on a watchful / waiting pattern, where he should assess the site tomorrow morning.    - if during the night or by tomorrow morning, he has progression in the size or quality of the irritated area, he should come in for further evaluation  - if he develops any systemic symptoms including fever, chills, rigors, he is to present to the ED immediately    Low threshold to send to ED as patient is immunosuppressed.

Cancer and its treatments can cause your white blood cell count to drop. This means your immune system is weakened. And when this happens, you are more likely to get an infection. Taking special care with food handling can help you avoid infections.  What should you look for when shopping for food?   Buy wrapped, pre-packaged foods, such as breads, bagels, muffins, rolls, cereals, noodles, and rice. Avoid open-bin bulk foods.   Look for foods that are packed as single servings. You will be less likely to have leftovers, which can spoil quickly.   Buy only pasteurized dairy products and pasteurized juices. """"Avoid raw milk, any yogurt or cheeses made with raw milk, and unpasteurized juice.   Be sure to wash all fresh fruits and vegetables well. You may want to switch from fresh fruits and vegetables to cooked, canned, or frozen fruits and vegetables during treatment.   Make sure that canned foods are safe. Check sell-by dates, and look for dents and other damage. Don't buy damaged or out-of-date cans.  What are safe food-handling practices?   Wash your hands with soap and warm water before and after you handle food. And wash your hands before you eat.   Wash fruits and vegetables before you cut or peel them.   Throw out any fruits or vegetables that are moldy or damaged.   Wash the tops of canned foods with soap and warm water before you open them.   Clean counters and cutting boards with soap and hot water, or use a bleach solution. To dilute household bleach, follow the directions on the label.   Keep your refrigerator at or below 40 F.  What are some safe cooking practices?   Cook meats, poultry, and fish until they are well done.   Cook eggs until the yolks and whites are solid.   Don't let foods sit out and reach room temperature.   Thaw meat in the refrigerator. Don't thaw meat on a counter or anywhere at room temperature.  What should you know about eating in restaurants?   Avoid salad bars, buffets, and deli counters.   Choose restaurants that practice good hygiene and safe food handling. You can check restaurant food-safety ratings on your local health department website.   Order only fully cooked foods and well-done meats. Avoid all raw fruits and vegetables.   Don't eat foods that contain raw fish, such as sushi.  Where can you learn more?  Go to Martinsburg Va Medical Center at https://myuncchart.org  Select Patient Education under American Financial.

There has been a decline in the numbers blasts. This is clearly not acceptable.     The regimen goes straight into the next round.   Patients do respond to the second cycle. This means getting a bone marrow biopsy in the 4th week of therapy.     If there is no response after two cycles, then the prognosis is poor. We generally recommend clinical trial at that point.     Our trial is an anti-CD47 antibody. The Duke one is similar.      Neutropenia:  The biggest risk to leukemia are fungal infections. Fungal spores are in the dirt, cut grass, and damp areas.  People get infected in two ways: Breath in the spores or the inoculate themselves.     We will are working on getting you posaconazole.  This is an anti-fungal drug. This interacts with venetoclax. When you start posaconazole, you need to get the venetoclax to one pill (100 mg a day)     The other antibiotic is levaquin.  This lowers the risk of febrile neutropenia. It does not improve survival.      Diet: The neutropenic diet has been disproven. Food safety is important.     I would start lisinopril at 5 mg a day.  We can cut this half if your blood pressure drops too much.  Take in the morning.     The line is good for 6 weeks. The alternative is a port.  I like to put these in when there is some count recovery.      PLAN:  1) Lisinopril 5 mg a day  2) Posaconazole 300 mg a day when available and lower the venetoclax to 100 mg at that time  3) Continue with bowel regimen  4) Venetoclax at 400 mg for now.   5) Daily injections for 7 days of azacitidine  6) Bone marrow biopsy in 3.5 weeks  7) Levaquin 500 mg a day   8) Valtrex daily in the morning  9) Metoprolol three times a day.   10) Zofran (ondansetron) for nausea   11) I will check with Sulin on the line care  12) Twice a week for blood checks and transfusions  13) I would see the Duke people     To reach me: Page 931-209-1797;    681 517 3158: Clinic Number  Reach Korea through MyChart.

He is NPM1 positive, FLT3 ITD negative, which usually suggests a favorable response to azacitidine/venetoclax.  Unfortunately, he failed to go into remission.  There is a subset of patients that will go into remission with cycle 2 of aza/ven.  Therefore, we will go straight into the next cycle without a dose reduction.  If that fails, we would recommend a clinical trial or perhaps an IDH1 inhibitor.      We discussed a number of other issues as documented in his AVS.  His plan is summarized below:    PLAN:   1) Begin Aza/ven at full dose (7 days, 400 mg)  2) When posaconazole is available, begin 300 mg every day and reduce venetoclax to 100 mg every day.    Posaconazole was added because of his persistent NP.  It was held in C1 due to possible interactions with amiodarone.  This drug will not be necessary   3) Begin lisinopril 5 mg QAM.  This is a 50% reduction from his ramipril dose. Hydrochlorothiazide  Will be held.   4) Continue with his Picc line.  If his counts recover, we can move to a Port.   5) BM Bx in 3.5 weeks; return to see me in 4 weeks. He will be seen by our pharmacist next week to make sure the dose reductions are implemented.   6) Continue metoprolol three times a day.   7) Zofran (ondansetron) for nausea; If he needs ongoing anti-emetics, I would consider Zyprexa given the constipation risk. Otherwise, he will continue with his Miralax. 8) Twice a week for blood checks and transfusions  9) He was encouraged to keep his visits with the physicians at Blackberry Center     HEME HX:   1/02/21: Presents with fevers, malaise (x 1 week) and leukocytosis.

His course has been complicated A fib and sterocoral colitis.      In general, he is feeling better.  He has been up and walking.  He notes occasional dizziness, but this is improving. He has had no falls.  He has not had episodes of rapid heart rate.  He notes some DOE when climbing 18 steps.  He feels his stamina is about 50% of normal.  It is improving since his DC.      He took ramipril and noticed a decline in his SBP to 86 (from the 140's).  He has had no CP. He denies sx c/w TIAs.  He has had some mild edema, but this is equivalent to what he saw prior to his hospitalization.  He has noticed a significant diuresis since leaving the hospital, which likely explains the weight loss of 3 to 4 lbs.     He is having regular bowel mov'ts and denies problems with urinary retention.  His only pain is near the SI joint where he had a marrow. He has had occasional HA that have been treated with Tylenol.  He has avoided caffeine and ETOH.      He has had no problems with his line.  He has had no fevers, chills, or UR sx.      He is adjusting to his diagnosis.

He states he noticed it the other day, and it affects his dorsiflexion, grip strength and overall ROM. He denies trauma, new wound, insect bite, overuse, recent fall, history of gout or arthritis, fever, chills, sweats, sick contacts. There is a small abrasion just distal to the swollen area that has been there x 3 weeks, however, he denies open wound or recent skin breakage. He endorses taking all of his prophylactic medications exactly as prescribed. He has never had anything like this before and is perplexed about the etiology. He states the area is approximately 50% improved since last night - as he kept his arm elevated and took tylenol.      Assessment/Plan:    Left wrist swelling  - L wrist Xray x 3 views to rule out trauma and establish baseline imaging = No acute osseous abnormality of the left wrist. Nonspecific soft tissue swelling.  - unclear etiology; could be possible cellulitic area from very small lesion just distal to swollen area of concern vs synovitis vs inflammatory arthritidies.   - in conjunction with Dr. Leotis Pain & Katie Buhlinger - will start Doxycycline 100mg  PO BID x 5 days for questionable cellulitis. Rx sent to local Biiospine Orlando pharmacy. Patient called and told to pick up Rx and start taking today.  - continue remainder prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal, antiviral (levaquin, posaconazole, valtrex)  - continue rest, ice, elevation   - re-assess tomorrow (2/11/21) when RTC for lab check.

He is NPM1 positive, FLT3 ITD negative, which usually suggests a favorable response to azacitidine/venetoclax.  Unfortunately, he failed to go into remission.  He has completed cycle two and is here for follow up.  He has a BMBx scheduled for next Thursday to evaluate response to cycle 2.  If this fails, we would recommend a clinical trial or perhaps an IDH1 inhibitor.      He sought a 2nd opinion at Select Specialty Hospital - Dallas (Garland).  Outcome is essentially to continue aza/ven until after 4 cycles so long as blast % is declining with each cycle.  If relapse or refractory disease they would also recommend IDH inhibitor (ivosidenib).  Also would consider ivosidenib to aza/ven though this could result in prolonged cytopenias.    He does have some swelling in his right ankle  He reports that this happened overnight when his home alarm went off and he mis-stepped.  The swelling is localized to his right ankle joint, with no swelling of the foot or calf.  He is elevating it in clinic today.  He does not feel films are required as he thinks it's a soft tissue injury, which I agree with.  No redness or warmth.  Continue rest, elevation, ice, compression.    He is taking posaconazole and has lowered his venetoclax appropriately.    Continues to have palpitations subjectively.  On auscultation, irregular rhythm noted.  Unfortunately, nothing caught on EKG.  Could consider Zio patch, though he is asymptomatic.    PLAN:   1) Continue Aza/ven at full dose (7 days, 100mg  - dose reduced for posa)  2) Continue posa 300mg  PO daily for persisent neutropenia  3) Continue lisinopril 5 mg QAM.    4) Continue with his Picc line.  If his counts recover, we can move to a Port.   5) BMBx next week as scheduled  6) Continue metoprolol three times a day.   7) EKG today  7) Zofran (ondansetron) for nausea; If he needs ongoing anti-emetics, I would consider Zyprexa given the constipation risk. Otherwise, he will continue with his Miralax.   8) Continue twice a week for blood checks and transfusions    Markus Jarvis, RN, MSN, AGPCNP-C  Nurse Practitioner  Hematologic Malignancies  South Florida State Hospital  (607)434-3667 (phone)  223-494-3528 (fax)  Lurena Joiner.@unchealth .http://herrera-sanchez.net/    I personally spent 60 minutes face-to-face and non-face-to-face in the care of this patient, which includes all pre, intra, and post visit time on the date of service.

Patient Education        Learning About Blood Transfusions  What is a blood transfusion?     Blood transfusion is a medical treatment to replace the blood or parts of blood that your body has lost. The blood goes through a tube from a bag to an intravenous (IV) catheter and into your vein.  You may need a blood transfusion after losing blood from an injury, a major surgery, an illness that causes bleeding, or an illness that destroys blood cells.  Transfusions are also used to give you the parts of bloodsuch as platelets, plasma, or substances that cause clottingthat your body needs to fight an illness or stop bleeding.  How is a blood transfusion done?  Before you receive a blood transfusion, your blood is tested to find out what your blood type is. Blood or blood parts that are a match with your blood type are ordered by your doctor. Blood is typed as A, B, AB, or O. It is also typed as Rh-positive or Rh-negative.  Your blood is also screened to look for antibodies that might react with the blood that is given to you. The blood you are getting is checked and rechecked to make sure that it's the right type for you.  A sample of your blood is mixed with a sample of the blood you will receive to check for problems. Before actually giving you the transfusion, a doctor and nurses will look at the label on the package of blood and compare it to your hospital ID bracelet and medical records. The transfusion begins only when all agree that this is the correct blood and that you are the correct person to receive it.  To receive the transfusion, you will have an intravenous (IV) catheter inserted into a vein. A tube connects the catheter to the bag containing the blood, which is placed higher than your body. The blood then flows slowly into your vein. A doctor or nurse will check you several times during the transfusion to watch for a reaction or other problems.  What are  the possible risks?  Blood transfusions have many benefits and are often life-saving. But they also have a few risks. Possible risks include:   Your body's reaction to receiving new blood. This """"may include:  ? Fever.  ? Allergic reactions.  ? Breathing problems.   An infection from the blood. This risk is small because of the strict rules placed on handling and storing blood. Getting a viral infection, such as HIV or hepatitis B or C, through blood transfusions has become very rare. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces strict guidelines on the collection, testing, storage, and use of blood.   Getting the wrong blood type by accident. Severe reactions, which can be life-threatening, are very rare.  How can you care for yourself at home?  To prevent infection at the transfusion site   Wash the area daily with warm, soapy water, and pat it dry. Don't use hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, which can slow healing. You may cover the area with a gauze bandage if it weeps or rubs against clothing. Change the bandage every day.   Keep the area clean and dry.  When should you call for help?  Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:   You have severe trouble breathing.  Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:   You have a fever.   You feel weaker or more tired than usual.   You have a yellow tint to your skin or the whites of your eyes.  Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if you have any problems.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.

I instructed him to immobilize the ankle for the next several days until we can take a look at it. He can also use ice if he gets swelling with additional use."

He failed to go into remission with one cycle of aza/ven.  He went on to a second cycle on day 29.  This as led to a leukemia free state.  His MRD measurement was negative though the specimen was quite hypocellular.  Without count recovery, I can't call it remission. However, given the overall improvement in his PS and platelet recovery, I suspect he will have a CRx.      His recovery will likely be delayed to at least March 11th or even the 18th.  If he has not recovered adequately by the 18th, I would rebiopsy him.  If he recovers, I would do the following:     Threshold for treatment: ANC of 1.0 and a platelet count of 75 since he is MRD negative.    He will likely not have a problem with platelet recovery. His ANC seems to be slower.  I may consider low dose GCSF.    If he has not recovered by the 18th, I would repeat his bone marrow biopsy.    Once he starts, I would reduce his dose.   Venetoclax to 21 days   Azacitidine to 35 mg/m2 x 5 days.  This is a 67% dose reduction as mandated by the NEJM protocol.     Continue posaconazole.  Stop this drug 2 days before starting treatment.    Continue Levaquin until ANC is > 0.5   Consider putting in a port when he recovers.        He is doing well otherwise.  He likely became volume overloaded with his transfusion regimen.  He does respond to Lasix.  I would do the following:    Take 40 mg of Lasix in the AM; stop with a drop in weight of 3 to 5 lbs.    Take lasix on the days of blood transfusion   Begin KCl 20 meq at bedtime.     HEME HX:   1/02/21: Presents with fevers, malaise (x 1 week) and leukocytosis.

During the past two weeks, he has had swelling in his wrist, which improved with doxycycline.  It is unclear if the abx was the reason for the improvement.  He has also had swelling in his legs bilaterally.  This responded to Lasix.  He has dropped about 4 lbs in the past week.      He has been increasing his activity.  He has had no falls.

I also don't have the molecular NPM1 test. This is the most sensitive test.     Overall, this is good.     The fact that you feel reasonable well and haven't needed platelets is a good sign.   It could be a while. I suspect you will be ready to start chemo again on March 11th though it could be the 18th.   If it takes longer OR you begin to have blasts on your blood smear OR you begin to become ill, we may need repeat the biopsy.     Remission: < 5% blasts and normal CBC  You are in a leukemia free state.     The plan    - IF you are MRD+, we will start with a neutrophil count > 0.5 and platelets > 50.    - IF you are MRD -, we will start with a neutrophil counts > 1.0 and platelets > 75   - We will (at least) reduce your azacitidine to 5 days (rather than 7) and your venetoclax to 21 days.    - STOP the venetoclax.    - I may reduce the total dose of azacitidine depending on your recovery.    - Continue the Noxafil until your neutrophils > 0.5. (we want to stop this drug 2 days before starting venetoclax).    - When you recover, we may want to put in a port.

You can take additional lasix IF you get a blood transfusion.  3) Stop Venetoclax  4) Take potassium at bedtime - and whenever you take an extra lasix.   5) I would stay with the lasix that you are on. I would stop it IF you drop another 3 to 5 lbs.    Take your weight each AM   If you drop 3 to 5 lbs, stop lasix   IF you increase by 2 or more lbs, take a second dose after lunch.

He should be there by Monday.  I will dose reduce per protocol.  We should check an NPM1 with each cycle until he clears.      The inflammation he is experiencing is a bit unusual  The redness does not correspond with the tenderness, making gout unlikely. The only way I can connect this with his AML is to call this an unusual form of Sweet's Syndrome.  IF so, he should respond to intermediate dose steroids. The differential dx also include cryoglobulins and pernio.     PLAN:    AML   Venetoclax to 21 days   Azacitidine to 35 mg/m2 x 5 days.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with RVR: He had one known episode of AF with RVR (symptomatic with palpitations) during his index hospitalization for AML. He denies any symptoms to suggest recurrence since that time. He has a history of PAC's that preceded his AML diagnosis, potentially suggesting a predisposition to atrial arrhythmias but his echocardiogram showed normal cardiac structure and function. He is in NSR with frequent PVCs today. We discussed atrial fibrillation at some length, focusing on rate vs. Rhythm control and anticoagulation:  --Rate/rhythm control: Given the absence of symptoms, there is no indication for rhythm control. We discussed the possibility that we might stop metoprolol today given low BPs but decided to continue the current dose of metoprolol tartrate 25 mg bid. Beta blockade may offer some PAC suppression and could protect against RVR should the PAF recur.  --Anticoagulation: His CHADs2VaSC2 score is 3 (3.2% annual stroke risk, 4.6% annual thromboembolic risk). His HASBLED score is 1 (rouhgly 1 bleed per 100 patient years). He has persistent, albeit mild, thrombocytopenia that could enhance bleeding risk. I will discuss risks/benefits with Dr. Leotis Pain and communicate our recommendation to Dr. Reuben Likes. If we opt to start anticoagulation, would choose apixaban (superior data in older patients, lack of drug-drug interaction)    2. Hypertension  Prior to his AML diagnosis, was treated with ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide. These were discontinued during hospital stay for AML diagnosis in Jan 2021 due to low BP and mild AKI. He was discharged on lisinopril but subsequently has stopped taking it due to low blood pressures at home. As we discussed, there is no reason to restart antihypertensives in the setting of low blood pressure.    3. HFpEF  He was prescribed lasix 40 mg at the time of hospital discharge in January, presumably as a treatment for HFpEF related to AF. He appears euvolemic to hypovolemic on exam today and his BP has been low at home, though he has bilateral ankle edema many days. I suggested that he decrease his daily dose to 20 mg. If his LE edema does not worsen he can try transitioning to only prn use.    4. AML  Ongoing management by Dr. Leotis Pain and Criselda Peaches. He has proliferative disease with monocytic differentiation (73% blasts). He has completed four cycle of azacitidine and venetoclax and continues to be in a leukemia free state as of 5/5/2021. While his WBC has somewhat improved (ANC up to 0.7 from 0.2), his platelets have decreased (61 in 1/1/21, nadir 8 on 1/8/21, up to 310 in 3/18/21, 82 on 5/24/21). Per 5/17/2021 clinic note, plan for ventoclax x 14 days and azacitidine to 35 mg/m2 x 5 days (67% dose reduction per NEJM protocol).     I did not make a follow-up visit as he receives excellent care from Dr. Zenaida Deed, but would be happy to see him again in the future should further questions or concerns arise,    Subjective:   PCP: Eulogio Bear, MD  Patient: Xian Alves  DOB: 08-Sep-1944    HPI: Lewie Deman is a 102 y.o. male who was referred by Doristine Section for evaluation of recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation in the setting of treatment for AML. In early January, he presented to Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital Of Miami with a  1 week history of fatigue, myalgias, and generalized weakness and fever. On presentation, he was found to have a WBC count of 43,300 and was diagnosed with AML with treatment with azacitidine and venetoclax initiated on Jan 5th. Early on Jan 6th, he complained of palpitations and was found to be in Afib w/ RVR. He was given fluids and started on metoprolol w/ some improvement initially. Then, overnight on Jan """"7th, he had episode of hypotension w/ HRs in the 150s that was treated with amiodarone IV and digoxin. Amiodarone was stopped the morning of Jan 7th given concerns for interactions w/ chemotherapy and was restarted on PO metoprolol with good improvements in heart rate. At the time of discharge, he is being continued on metoprolol 25mg  TID with recommendations to maintain good PO hydration.      Today, Mr. Killman reports feeling well. He tolerates all ADLs including heavy yardwork (cutting limbs, trimming bushes and replanting). He also hits balls at the driving range for 45 minutes several times per week. In general, he feels he is about \""""two thirds\"""" back to normal.  Prior to his illness, he was walking 3 miles but now he walks 0.5-1 miles but at a much slower pace. He does admit that if he walks briskly he may experience mild DOE. He tolerates 18 stairs in his home or several flights of stairs in the Center For Change parking garage with no symptoms.  He denies chest pain, palpitation and syncope. However, he has had a few episodes of presyncope while working in the yard. In response, he discontinued lisinopril and reduced metoprolol 25 mg TID to BID. He has had no presyncope since then. Since then, his home vital signs include 95-105/55-60 and HR 60s and these are similar to prior to making these medications. Also, baseline HR (prior to AML diagnosis) was in 60s. His appetite is mildly reduced but he eats regular meals. He did lose about 12 lbs during his illness in Jan/Feb and has not regained that weight but also does not feel he needs to. He does occasionally will skip his diuretic dose but then notices some mild LE edema. He reports moderate sodium intake.    ______________________________________________________________________    Pertinent Medical History, Cardiovascular History & Procedures:    Pertinent PMH:   Hypertension   History of femur fracture   Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation   AML    Cath / PCI:   None"""" CV Surgery:    None    EP Procedures and Devices:   None    Non-Invasive Evaluation(s):   Stress echocardiogram 2008 normal    TTE 1/9/21    1.

I would get them 6/30 to 7/02.   3) If you get fever, take the Levaquin and call me.   4) I would take the apixiban 2.5 mg twice a day. I want to talk to my pharmacist first. This needs to be held 24 to 48 hours before procedure. The main side effect bleeding.   5) Continue treatment as is     Anticoagulation: Stroke is devastating. Its not simply preventing an event; its preventing a bad event.     Let's talk about relapse: You will have an increase in your NPM1 long before you have a drop in platelets. The DOACs are reasonably safe. The biggest risk is the fall risk. Your prognosis is good enough to justify anti-coagulation.     Your prognosis is good enough to make a year long financial decision.  You do have an IDH1 mutation. There is a drug that we use as second line.     I think you are in the Goldilocks zone - if your counts are too high, I would likely increase your therapy.  I would likely start with extending venetoclax to 3 weeks. (Neutrophil > 2.0, plts > 150)    I would wear a mask in contact with people w/ uncertain vaccination and in areas of high mold counts.

He was in a leukemia free state on the 24th of February and a molecular CR by March 15. He is tolerating therapy well. His activity and stamina are improving; he has been transfusion free; and he has maintained a 4 week cycle.      We did discuss the use of a DOAC for prevention of CVA associated with a fib.  He qualifies for use of this drug when comparing his CHA2DS2-VASc score to his HAS-BLED score.  These scores do not account for his AML.  Eliquis has minimal interactions with his venetoclax.  I feel this is safe to use given the stability of his platelet count.  In general we use a platelet threshold of 50 for anti-coagulation. We also have to consider his long term prognosis, which is limited.  At this point, I would expect progression in 12 months. He does have other options including the use of a IDH inhibitor.  These are generally associated with PFS of 6 months.      We can lower his prophylaxis given his counts    PLAN:    AML   Venetoclax to 21 days   Azacitidine to 35 mg/m2 x 5 days.  This is a 67% dose reduction as mandated by the NEJM protocol.

He was in a leukemia free state on the 24th of February and a molecular CR by March 15. He is tolerating therapy well. His activity and stamina are improving; he has been transfusion free; and he has maintained a 4 week cycle.      We did discuss the use of a DOAC for prevention of CVA associated with a fib.  He qualifies for use of this drug when comparing his CHA2DS2-VASc score to his HAS-BLED score.  These scores do not account for his AML.  Eliquis has minimal interactions with his venetoclax.  I feel this is safe to use given the stability of his platelet count.  In general we use a platelet threshold of 50 for anti-coagulation. We also have to consider his long term prognosis, which is limited.  At this point, I would expect progression in 12 months. He does have other options including the use of a IDH inhibitor.  These are generally associated with PFS of 6 months.      We can lower his prophylaxis given his counts    PLAN:    AML   Venetoclax to 21 days   Azacitidine to 35 mg/m2 x 5 days.

Atrial flutter/fibrillation  Had a long discussion regarding his complicated course this calendar year.  Reviewed diagnosis of atrial flutter/fibrillation made during index hospitalization January 2021.  Has not had symptomatic recurrence since then.  Also reviewed echocardiogram at that time showing normal contractile function with mild valvular disease.  We did review the potential that atrial fibrillation/flutter may have been a product of his acute illness, initial work-up/treatment, etc.  However, he is still undergoing therapy and may be at risk for recurrence.  With this in mind, reviewed risks and benefits of continuing anticoagulation.  CHA2DS2-VASc is 3.  After reviewing options, we made a mutual decision to continue Eliquis 5 mg twice daily.  I did review recent labs from 8/12/2021.  CBC showed platelet count 81.  As long as platelets are greater than 50, I am comfortable continuing Eliquis.  Also, creatinine 1.18.  He will continue the 5 mg bid dose.  Also, currently doing well with current dose of metoprolol.  Palpitation symptoms have not been an issue recently.  I did offer to switch metoprolol tartrate to metoprolol succinate but he has to take Eliquis twice daily anyway.  Plan to continue current regimen.    2.  Hypertension  Well-controlled, continue current regimen.

Since his last visit, he was diagnosed with AML January 2021.  During his index hospitalization, he also developed atrial fibrillation/flutter which resolved prior to discharge.  He has been undergoing chemotherapy and reports doing well at this time.  In fact, he was even able to play golf recently and has been hitting golf balls regularly despite the heat.  He has also returned to work part-time.  From the cardiac standpoint, he denies any chest pain or shortness of breath.  He reports occasional PACs but in general has not noted any concerning palpitation symptoms.  He feels they are well controlled with his current regimen.  He does bruise easily but denies problematic bleeding.  He does not notice much difference in terms of severity of bruising with Eliquis compared to aspirin.  He does report periodic left ankle swelling but otherwise denies other pertinent complaints today.    ______________________________________________________________________    Pertinent Medical History, Cardiovascular History & Procedures:    Pertinent PMH:   Hypertension   Atrial flutter/fibrillation January 2021   AML diagnosed January 2021   History of femur fracture    Cath / PCI:   None    CV Surgery:    None    EP Procedures and Devices:   None    Non-Invasive Evaluation(s):   TTE 1/2021: Normal EF, mild MR   Stress echocardiogram 2008 normal    ______________________________________________________________________    Other past medical history, social history, family history, medications, allergies and problem list reviewed in the medical record.

He was in a leukemia free state after his first cycle and had a molecular CR by cycle 3.  He has continued in this molecular CR since that time.     The only persistent issue has been his mild neutropenia.  While he has maintained an ANC > 0.5, he is becoming symptomatic as documented by his oral ulcers. Unfortunately, the 10 day delay in his treatment did not lead to much improvement.  We can respond by further decreasing his venetoclax to 7 days and adding GCSF.  I would like to see more recovery in his ANC so that he can get his dental work.  Therefore, we will make plans to do both.     His episodes of myalgias and malaise was likely viral.  I suspect the drop in his hemoglobin is secondary to this illness.  It may take 6 to 8 weeks to recover from his anemia.       PLAN  1) Decrease to 7 days of venetoclax  2) Get a CBC on November 4th; IF his ANC is < 0.5, we will begin GCSF  3) He is cleared for dental work during the 4th week of the cycle (which begins on 11/04)  4) If his hemoglobin does not show signs of recovery, I would consider a bone marrow biopsy to assess for an underlying or secondary MDS.    5) Follow up in about 4 weeks for cycle 10    HEME HX:   1/02/21: Presents with fevers, malaise (x 1 week) and leukocytosis.    ??

Injection instructions   o Take 1 syringe out of the refrigerator and allow to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes  o Wash hands and remove syringe from the tray  o Check the syringe for the following   - Expiration date  - Medication is clear and colorless to slightly yellow and free from particles. You may see a small air bubble in the liquid but this is normal.  - It appears unused or damaged and the needle cap is securely attached and the needle guard has not been activated  o Choose your injection site (abdomen but not within 2 inches of navel, thigh or if someone else is injecting may also use upper arms or upper outer area of buttocks)  o Clean the injection site with an alcohol wipe using a circular motion and allow to air dry completely  o Hold the prefilled syringe by the body (the clear plastic needle guard) with the needle pointing up.  Carefully pull the needle cap straight off and discard.  o Check the syringe for an air bubble.  Gently tap the syringe with your fingers until the air bubble rises to the top of the syringe. Slowly push the plunger up to push any air out of the syringe and stop when you see a small drop start to appear at the needle tip.  o Continue to hold the syringe upright and slowly press the plunger to push out the excess medicine until the edge of the plunger stopper lines up with the syringe markings for your prescribed dose (0.3, 0.4 or 0.5)  o With one hand gently pinch the skin at the injection site.  With your other hand insert the needle into your skin at a 45-90 degree angle (keep skin pinched while injecting)  o Push the plunger head down to deliver dose using a slow and constant pressure until the plunger head reaches the bottom and hold syringe in place for 5 seconds  o Keep the plunger fully pressed down while you carefully pull the needle straight out from the injection site.  o Slowly release the plunger and allow the needle guard to automatically cover the exposed needle   o If there is blood at the injection site gently press a cotton ball or gauze to the site.

As a general rule, AML patients respond vaccines.   I would check your antibody titer in about 4 weeks.   IF this titer is negative, then I would recommend Evusheld. It is given once every 6 months as subcutaneous shot.     IF you are exposed to COVID, let Korea know - I would use prophylaxis in that setting.     Is there a tail on this survival curve? It is kind a looking that way.  NPM1 patients seem to be doing the best.     NPM1 begins to rise months before there is measurable disease.   You do have an IDH mutation and this is targetable.

He was in a leukemia free state after his first cycle and had a molecular CR by cycle 3.  He has continued in this molecular CR since that time.     He hsa struggled with neutropenia.  Given his negative NPM1, I am assuming this is a treatment effect.  We have reduced to his chemotherapy to 5 days of azacitidine with a 50% reduction and venetoclax to 5 days.  This reduction has allowed him to continue on a 4 week schedule.  Given the delayed nature of his NP, I would reduce his azacitidine to 20 mg/m2 for his upcoming cycles.  I would like to see if it is possible to continue therapy without the need for GCSF support.      We discussed his COVID risk at length.  He may be at an increased risk of COVID due to his therapy, but this treatment does not automatically result in a poor vaccine response.  If he has had no response to the COVID vaccine, I would repeat his vaccine.  IF he was still negative, I would consider Evusheld.  We talked about this product at length and the nature of both pre-exposure prophylaxis and EUA.  (See his AVS).      PLAN  1) Start the cycle today: 5 days aza and 5 day venetoclax (1/19)  2) CBC on 2/07; he was asked to contact Korea through MyChart once this is complete.  I would begin GCSF (three times per week) IF his ANC was < 0.5.   3) Check his COVID titers on 2/07.    If negative, administer a 4th vaccine and recheck titers in 6 weeks.    If positive, no more intervention is needed.   3) Reduce azacitidine to 20 mg/m2 x 5 days for cycle 14  with the goal of avoiding GCSF and maintaining a 4 week schedule; continue with 5 days of venetoclax  4) Continue to follow NPM1    HEME HX:   1/02/21: Presents with fevers, malaise (x 1 week) and leukocytosis.

Today is D16 of his aza/ven regimen (he gets venetoclax 400 mg D1-5 and aza 20 mg/m2 D1-5). His ANC is 0.3 today. He feels well.     Plan:  - He should start levaquin 500 mg daily (he has some at home)  - He has a 3-day supply of Zarxio at home in his refrigerator. He should NOT start that. Upon consideration of the next cycle if counts are too low to proceed, the next cycle should be delayed x 1 week with provider follow-up rescheduled, and GCSF can be used MWF x 3 doses. When ANC > 1.0 (and PLT > 50), can proceed with next cycle  - If he does require a cycle delay, we have maxed out on dose reductions. Can consider extending cycle duration to every 5 weeks and keep at current doses.      Manfred Arch, PharmD, BCOP, CPP  Pager: 662-282-0362"

He was in a leukemia free state after his first cycle and had a molecular CR by cycle 3.  He has continued in this molecular CR since that time.     He hsa struggled with neutropenia.  Given his negative NPM1, I am assuming this is a treatment effect.  We have reduced to his chemotherapy to 5 days of azacitidine with a 50% reduction and venetoclax to 5 days.  This reduction has allowed him to continue on a 4 week schedule.  Given the delayed nature of his NP, I would reduce his azacitidine to 20 mg/m2 for his upcoming cycles.  I would like to see if it is possible to continue therapy without the need for GCSF support.      We discussed his COVID risk at length.  He may be at an increased risk of COVID due to his therapy, but this treatment does not automatically result in a poor vaccine response.  If he has had no response to the COVID vaccine, I would repeat his vaccine.  IF he was still negative, I would consider Evusheld.  We talked about this product at length and the nature of both pre-exposure prophylaxis and EUA.  (See his AVS).      PLAN  1) Start the cycle today: 5 days aza and 5 day venetoclax (1/19)  2) CBC on 2/07; he was asked to contact Korea through MyChart once this is complete.  I would begin GCSF (three times per week) IF his ANC was < 0.5.   3) Check his COVID titers on 2/07.   ?? If negative, administer a 4th vaccine and recheck titers in 6 weeks.   ?? If positive, no more intervention is needed.   3) Reduce azacitidine to 20 mg/m2 x 5 days for cycle 14  with the goal of avoiding GCSF and maintaining a 4 week schedule; continue with 5 days of venetoclax  4) Continue to follow NPM1    HEME HX:   1/02/21: Presents with fevers, malaise (x 1 week) and leukocytosis.    ??

Atrial flutter/fibrillation  Overall doing well though does report one episode of recurrent atrial arrhythmia earlier this week.  Electrocardiogram today shows sinus bradycardia with first-degree AV block.  TTE reviewed from January 2021 showing normal ejection fraction with mild MR.  Reviewed options with patient including rhythm control with multaq versus rate control with metoprolol.  As this was his first recurrence in over 1 year, we settled on ongoing rate control with metoprolol.  I have advised him to continue daily dosing at twice daily due to relatively slow sinus rates.  However, I advised him to take an additional dose as needed with recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation.  He communicated understanding and was agreeable with the plan.  I have also asked him to let me know if symptoms progress at which point we would reevaluate the options.  Otherwise, he will remain on Eliquis 5 mg twice daily.  Reviewed CMP from yesterday showing creatinine 1.03.  However, he also had CBC showing platelet count 86.  I have advised him to hold Eliquis if platelet count drops below 50.

He reports his chest felt funny and he noticed irregular palpitations.  Approximately 1 hour later, he took an extra dose of metoprolol.  He woke up overnight and reports it was gone by 4:30 AM.  He denies any other associated symptoms.  He specifically denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness.  Otherwise, he reports doing well at this time.  He does feel slightly short of breath walking uphill.  However, he feels this is commensurate with his malignancy and anemia.  He has been able to continue working part-time as a Marine scientist with the Texas and also playing golf.  He is content with quality of life and seems accepting of the specter of recurrent malignancy and limited prognosis.    ______________________________________________________________________    Pertinent Medical History, Cardiovascular History & Procedures:    Pertinent PMH:   Hypertension   Atrial flutter/fibrillation January 2021   AML diagnosed January 2021   History of femur fracture    Cath / PCI:   None    CV Surgery:    None    EP Procedures and Devices:   None    Non-Invasive Evaluation(s):   TTE 1/2021: Normal EF, mild MR   Stress echocardiogram 2008 normal    ______________________________________________________________________    Other past medical history, social history, family history, medications, allergies and problem list reviewed in the medical record.

We will follow the plan below.      Your neutrophil count is really too low to treat.  The assumption is that this is low because progression of disease.      Does my marrow look like its is slowly recovering?  If it was, you would wait until your neutrophils recovered.     However, the assumption is that the increased blasts and disease progression are the reasons for the low neutrophil count.  If this is true, then the treatment does not work and you are increasing toxicity without benefit.      If your disease is adequately treated, then you should have neutrophils.     I do have questions of my own ... what is up with the NPM1?  Your NPM1 from the marrow is negative.  This suggests that your marrow is potentially healthier than we think ... you should begin recover or you have had subclonal progression.  The latter is a well known phenomenon in NPM1 mutated disease.    - Scenario 1 (healthy marrow): The blasts are normal and you need more time to recover.    - Scenario 2: The blasts are abnormal and you will not recover and these blasts grew through therapy.     You don't want to treat resistant disease.      We will have a good idea of what is happening when your myeloid mutation panel is back.  Do you still have an IDH1 mutation?   - MMP: Normal (+/- DNMT3A mutation) ... I would wait (and consider Aza/ven)   - IDH1 mutation is present: I would start ivosidinib. This is IDH1 inhibitor. Response are 30 and 50%.  It is well tolerated.  It has two main side effects: QTc prolongation and differentiation syndrome.    - Other mutations present (e.g. TP53): This has a particularly poor prognosis. Clinical trial would be recommended.      The sooner you treat, the lower risk of side effects.

Unfortunately, he has relapsed with 8% blasts. His myeloid mutation panel does show IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations.  However, this subclone does not have mutations in NPM1 and NRAS.  Subclonal progression with the loss of NPM1 is well known event.  He has also picked up a del(7q). This is a particularly poor prognostic sign.      We discussed treatment at length.  I am recommending the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib.  We reviewed the side effects including differentiation syndrome.  We will need to follow up on his QTc, which is normal at baseline.  He agrees to start this therapy.  I told him that his median PFS is close to 6 months.      PLAN  1) Begin Ivosidenib 500 mg every day; administer with a high fat meal.   2) FU with pharmacy to review the side effects and administration  3) FU with me 2 to 3 weeks after initiation.

Unfortunately, he has relapsed with 8% blasts. His myeloid mutation panel does show IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations.  However, this subclone does not have mutations in NPM1 and NRAS.  Subclonal progression with the loss of NPM1 is well known event.  He has also picked up a del(7q). This is a particularly poor prognostic sign.      He has responded to therapy with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  He is also tolerating the treatment well. He does have some circulating blasts on his PB smear.  While this is somewhat problematic, his bone marrow biopsy is a better reflection of his disease control. At this point, I would continue therapy.

TTE reviewed from January 2021 showing normal ejection fraction with mild MR. We have previously discussed options of rate control versus rhythm control.  At this point, he is doing very well, we will plan to continue metoprolol at current dose.  He does report some progressive fatigue.  I do not suspect beta-blocker as culprit but rather worry about worsening anemia.  Reviewed labs from the end of August showing hemoglobin less than 9.9, lower than previous values.  We will repeat CBC today.  Also reviewed risks and benefits of anticoagulation.  He has been off Eliquis due to thrombocytopenia.  Most recent platelet count 54.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  Subclonal progression with the loss of NPM1 is well known event.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.      Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  Furthermore, he is tolerating the treatment well.     Unfortunately, he has developed mild cytopenias.  Based on his most recent mutation testing, this appears to be due to the prominence of yet another clone.  This clone is characterized by a ZRSR2. Since the VAF of this mutation is close to the VAF of his IDH mutation, it is possible this is a subclone of his original disease.  Alternatively, this could be a new clone that is the result of treatment.  Clones with splicesome mutations can be considered a form of MDS.  However, he is asymptomatic, not requiring transfusions, and does not have excess blasts. His LDH is also normal, which suggests there is not a great deal of cell turnover.  Given these observations, I would continue his current therapy.      I should add that there are no standard therapies if he progresses to leukemia.  We can consider starting decitabine if his counts drop further.       His platelet count is slowly dropping.  I would stop his Eliquis because I suspect his platelets will drop below 50.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  Subclonal progression with the loss of NPM1 is well known event.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.      Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  Furthermore, he is tolerating the treatment well.     He did develop mild cytopenias two months after starting ivosidenib, which is not considered a side effect.  Based on mutation testing at the time, it appeared to be due to the prominence of yet another clone.  This clone was characterized by a ZRSR2. Since the VAF of this mutation is close to the VAF of his IDH mutation, it is possible this is a subclone of his original disease.  Alternatively, this could be a new clone that is the result of treatment.  Clones with splicesome mutations can be considered a form of MDS.  However, he is asymptomatic, not requiring transfusions, and does not have excess blasts. His LDH is also normal, which suggests there is not a great deal of cell turnover.  Given these observations, I decided to continue his current therapy.  Overall, this seems to be a reasonable decision since he continues to show signs of improvement      I should add that there are no standard therapies if he progresses to leukemia.  We can consider starting decitabine if his counts drop further.       PLAN:  1) Continue Ivosidenib  2) I would repeat his marrow IF    - Platelets < 20   - Hgb < 8.0   - ANC < 0.2   - Presence of circulating blasts.   3) RTC in 3 months   4) DC levaquin (given his ANC) and his valtrex (given  his ALC).  He has received the Shingrex vaccine.    5) We did talk about the need to contact Korea IF he should get COVID.     HEME HX:   1/02/21: Presents with fevers, malaise (x 1 week) and leukocytosis.

Atrial flutter/fibrillation  Symptomatically doing very well recently, no symptomatic episodes.  He is regular on examination today.  Reviewed EKG July 2022 showing sinus bradycardia.  TTE reviewed from January 2021 showing normal ejection fraction with mild MR. We have previously discussed options of rate control versus rhythm control.  At this point, he is doing very well, we will plan to continue metoprolol at current dose.  We did have a lengthy discussion regarding risk of stroke.  CHA2DS2-VASc is 3.  However, we have not pursued anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia.  Most recent platelet count in January was 76.  We will repeat CBC today.  Discussed risks and benefits of anticoagulation.  If platelets are stable or improved, we discussed potentially initiating Eliquis.  Briefly discussed low-dose versus full dose.  Patient is agreeable to either pending results.    2.  Hypertension  Blood pressure well controlled.  Reviewed chemistry profile from January with stable electrolytes and renal function.  Continue metoprolol.    ADDENDUM: Platelet count much better, will start eliquis 5 mg bid.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  Subclonal progression with the loss of NPM1 is well known event.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.      Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  Furthermore, he is tolerating the treatment well. He has developed another clone (ZRSR2) and it is unclear if a subclone of original disease or result of treatment.    Dr. Reuben Likes has now had 16 cycles of ivosidenib without significant side effects.  His platelet count and ANC are stable.  He continues to work part time.  His PS is excellent.  There is no evidence of progression at this time.     It is not clear if the CP he is experiencing is stable angina. I encouraged him to undergo stress testing.  He would be a candidate for DAPT if needed. At this point, I would not recommend regular ECG unless there was a change in medication that could effect his QTc.

Chest discomfort, shortness of breath  Patient reports exertional chest discomfort and shortness of breath.  Symptoms have improved a bit since discontinuation of beta-blocker but still do persist.  EKG today shows sinus rhythm without diagnostic ischemic changes.  Reviewed CT chest from 2021 that does show coronary calcifications.  Reviewed options with patient.  I recommended a myocardial perfusion study to risk stratify him.  We discussed likely only pursuing coronary angiography for high risk findings; otherwise, given his symptom burden, age, comorbidities, etc., would otherwise focus on medical therapy.  Patient agreeable with the plan.    2.  Atrial flutter/fibrillation  Symptomatically doing very well recently, no symptomatic episodes in some time.  He is regular on examination today.  Reviewed EKG today showing sinus rhythm.  He does continue metoprolol due to side effects of fatigue, palpitations, chest discomfort, swelling, etc. and he feels much better.  At this point, will not keep him on standing beta-blocker.  We discussed transitioning this only to as needed for recurrent atrial fibrillation.  Patient agreeable with the plan.  Also reviewed ongoing risks and benefits of anticoagulation.  CHA2DS2-VASc is 3.  This has been a recurrent conversation due to his chemotherapy and thrombocytopenia.  Unfortunately, he recently suffered a fall playing tennis and has extensive ecchymoses.  Currently holding Eliquis.  After reviewing risks and benefits, he will continue to hold Eliquis for now and we will continue to readdress.    3.  Hypertension  Blood pressure has gone up a bit, both in the office and at home.  Previously did well with ACE inhibitor.  Reviewed chemistry profile 8/1/2023 with stable electrolytes and renal function.  We will start lisinopril 5 mg daily, though did discuss potential need to uptitrate.  Will reassess next visit.

Since his last visit, he has had a complicated course.  Starting in March, he noticed chest discomfort and shortness of breath when walking uphill.  He had a couple similar episodes into early June.  He would only noticed this when doing something unusually strenuous.  Along with this, he had begun to notice palpitations as well as lower extremity swelling.  1 day in June, he forgot his beta-blocker and surprisingly started to feel better.  He felt like he had a bit more energy, swelling improved, and palpitations improved.  He subsequently weaned himself off and has noticed less chest discomfort and shortness of breath as well.  He overall feels much better off metoprolol than he did taking it.  That said, he has noticed a couple episodes of shortness of breath when walking briskly.  He also had vague discomfort in his chest the other day as well.  The chest discomfort only occurs with strenuous exertion.  Unfortunately, he also injured his right clavicle and scapula.  He was playing tennis 2 weeks ago.  He slipped reaching for a ball, fell  on his right side, and suffered the injuries.  He has also had extensive bruising which is slowly improving.  Nonoperative management is being pursued for the fractures.    ______________________________________________________________________    Pertinent Medical History, Cardiovascular History & Procedures:    Pertinent PMH:  Hypertension  Atrial flutter/fibrillation January 2021  AML diagnosed January 2021  History of femur fracture    Cath / PCI:  None    CV Surgery:   None    EP Procedures and Devices:  None    Non-Invasive Evaluation(s):  TTE 1/2021: Normal EF, mild MR  Stress echocardiogram 2008 normal    ______________________________________________________________________    Other past medical history, social history, family history, medications, allergies and problem list reviewed in the medical record.

Chest discomfort, shortness of breath  Patient reports exertional chest discomfort suggestive of typical angina.  Symptoms have improved a bit since discontinuation of beta-blocker but still do persist.  EKG from last visit shows sinus rhythm without diagnostic ischemic changes.  Reviewed results of myocardial perfusion study which were read as normal.  Discussed this with patient.  We reviewed differential at this point which would include microvascular dysfunction, false negative study (possibly related to balanced ischemia), etc.  We discussed the best way to proceed at this point.  In particular, patient had questions regarding whether interventions would be geared toward improvement of outcomes versus improvement of symptoms.  I discussed that possible coronary angiography with revascularization would largely be for symptomatic benefit unless he were to have high risk anatomy (left main disease, for instance).  Given this information, we elected not to proceed with coronary angiography.  I did discussed initiating antianginal therapy.  He does report PVCs associated with angina, discussed potential trial of calcium channel blocker as he did not do well previously with beta-blockers.  He states symptoms are not obtrusive so he would prefer not to initiate therapy.  Also briefly discussed potentially starting statins.  Patient reports limited prognosis with his AML diagnosis.  Because of this, we will not not add additional prophylactic medication at this time.  Also, he is not on aspirin due to thrombocytopenia and previous issues with bruising.    2.  Atrial flutter/fibrillation  Symptomatically doing very well recently, no symptomatic episodes in some time.  He is regular on examination today.  Will not initiate any therapy.  Also reviewed ongoing risks and benefits of anticoagulation.  CHA2DS2-VASc is 3 but he has not had atrial fibrillation in a long time.  This has been a recurrent conversation due to his chemotherapy and thrombocytopenia.  He is currently off Eliquis and will not reinitiate today as I am unclear as if benefits necessarily outweigh the risks.    3.  Hypertension  Blood pressure better controlled with lisinopril 10 mg daily.  We will check chemistry profile and consolidate prescription to 10 mg tablet once daily.      I personally spent greater than 40 minutes in face-to-face and non-face-to-face care of this patient, which includes all pre, intra, and post visit time on the date of service.

Since his last visit, he reports generally stable symptoms.  He continues to notice a substernal chest discomfort if he is walking uphill.  This is associated with PVCs.  It typically occurs when his heart rate reaches 100 510 bpm.  It is better if he stops and rests for about a minute.  He will he notices this when going for a walk with his wife.  He does not notice it at other times.  He denies unusual shortness of breath, near syncope, or other pertinent complaints otherwise.  He had also contacted me because blood pressure was suboptimally controlled with lisinopril 5 mg daily.  We therefore increased to 10 mg daily.  He reports blood pressures have been running 120s over 60s on this dose.    ______________________________________________________________________    Pertinent Medical History, Cardiovascular History & Procedures:    Pertinent PMH:  Hypertension  Atrial flutter/fibrillation January 2021  AML diagnosed January 2021  History of femur fracture    Cath / PCI:  None    CV Surgery:   None    EP Procedures and Devices:  None    Non-Invasive Evaluation(s):  Myocardial perfusion study 10/2023: Normal  TTE 1/2021: Normal EF, mild MR  Stress echocardiogram 2008 normal    ______________________________________________________________________    Other past medical history, social history, family history, medications, allergies and problem list reviewed in the medical record.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  Subclonal progression with the loss of NPM1 is well known event.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.      Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  Furthermore, he is tolerating the treatment well. He has developed another clone (ZRSR2) and it is unclear if a subclone of original disease or result of treatment.    Dr. Reuben Likes has now had 19 months of ivosidenib without significant side effects.  His platelet count and ANC are stable.  He continues to work part time.  His PS is excellent.  There is no evidence of progression at this time.     He continues to have chest pain with significant exertion. Pharmacologic stress testing was unremarkable (though HR did not exceed 97 bpm) and decision was made with cardiology not to pursue further workup. Symptoms only occur rarely and he declined anti-anginal therapy. He is no longer on rate control or anticoagulation for history of atrial fibrillation, which has not recurred since AML induction.     His traumatic leg wound is healing and there is no longer need for antibiotics.

Underwent pharmacologic stress on 10/11/23 with no symptoms, but max HR was only 95. He discussed with cardiology and as further intervention would only offer symptomatic (but not survival benefit) decision was made to forego further testing. He is no longer on apixaban for afib after falling and bruiisng heavily after playing tennis over the summer. He is not taking a beta blocker either as A-fib has not recurred since initial hospitalization for AML.   PS: There has been no change in his PS. He continues to work and Education administrator.   ID: When he was placing welded wire to keep deer out, the edges caught the bottom of his leg and created a small wound. After 10-12 days the bruised area around the wound became red and he began taking cephalexin (currently day 9) 1500 mg / day. It is mostly healed now. Prior to radiology he trained in EM and general surgery and is very comfortable with wound care.   B Sx: His wt is stable;   The rest of his ROS is negative.

Chest discomfort, shortness of breath  Patient reports exertional chest discomfort suggestive of typical angina.  Symptoms have improved a bit since discontinuation of beta-blocker but still do persist and are stable from last visit. Reviewed results of myocardial perfusion study 10/2023 which were read as normal.  Discussed this with patient.  We previously reviewed differential which would include microvascular dysfunction, false negative study (possibly related to balanced ischemia), etc.  We discussed the best way to proceed at this point.  As outlined at last visit, patient is not overly troubled by symptoms in the absence of any clear outcomes improvement, he would favor more conservative approach.  Discussed possibly starting calcium channel blocker today as he reports concomitant PVCs.  After reviewing risks and benefits, will start diltiazem 120 mg daily.  We discussed side effects to be mindful of.  Otherwise, he is not on aspirin given thrombocytopenia and bleeding/bruising diathesis.  We also discussed statins previously.  Due to limited prognosis with AML diagnosis, he elected not to pursue.  Will continue to evaluate risks or benefits.    2.  Atrial flutter/fibrillation  Patient had first recurrent episode earlier this month in quite some time.  Fortunately, episode was fairly brief, resolved within 30 minutes.  No indication to pursue rate or rhythm control at this time.  CHA2DS2-VASc is 3.  We have reviewed risks and benefits in the past.  Due to issues with bleeding, bruising, and thrombocytopenia with his AML in addition to very small burden of atrial fibrillation, we made a mutual decision not to pursue Eliquis at this time.  We will continue to weigh risks and benefits.    3.  Hypertension  Blood pressure better controlled with lisinopril 10 mg daily.  Chemistry profile reviewed 11/2023 with stable electrolytes and renal function.  Continue current regimen.

Since his last visit, he reports generally stable symptoms.  He continues to notice a substernal chest discomfort if he is walking uphill.  This is associated with PVCs.  He does not consistently notice it as he has not always exerting himself to that degree.  He also had an episode of atrial fibrillation earlier this month.  He reports some stress at home when dealing with a leaky daughter.  He has been having trouble getting this fixed.  When this was occurring, he developed palpitations and felt off.  He noted his pulse to be irregular and felt he was in atrial fibrillation.  He took a dose of metoprolol.  He was due lie down anyway.  He slept 30 minutes, woke, and symptoms had resolved.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  Subclonal progression with the loss of NPM1 is well known event.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.      Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  Furthermore, he is tolerating the treatment well. He has developed another clone (ZRSR2) and it is unclear if a subclone of original disease or result of treatment.    Dr. Reuben Likes has now had nearly two years of ivosidenib without significant side effects.  Unfortunately, his hgb, ANC, and platelet count are beginning to fall.  This may be related to his infection from several weeks ago. However, I suspect this is progression.     We discussed these findings at length.  We have decided to delay a bone marrow and give him some time to recover.  Since we do not have a good solution for him, I am fine with this plan.  We did talk about clinical trials since this will likely be his best option.       PLAN:  1) Continue Ivosidenib  2) Repeat a CBC in 6 weeks.

He reports the pain is right below the xiphoid process and he rates it about a 3 1/2 on a pain scale from 1-10.  He reports it is not really tender but never goes away.  Bowel movements have been normal with no cramping or blood (a little constipated but miralax is working).  Dr Leotis Pain had already switched the pt from amoxicillin to levofloxacin and he completed that about 3 days ago.       Triage Recommendations: RN recommended trying protonix for about a week or so to see if that will ease the pain.  The pt is currently at the hospital with his wife (on 5th floor BT as she broke her hip this past weekend).  Pt will plan to start protonix once he can pick some up.  If Dr Leotis Pain has other ideas/suggestions, pt would like a call back."

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  Subclonal progression with the loss of NPM1 is well known event.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.      Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  Furthermore, he is tolerating the treatment well. He has developed another clone (ZRSR2) and it is unclear if a subclone of original disease or result of treatment.    Dr. Reuben Likes has now had two years of ivosidenib without significant side effects.  Unfortunately, he has had decreases in his platelet count over the past several months. This may be related to his previous infections. His platelet count may be recovering.  In addition, he has developed a mild eosinophilia, which may suggest a mild allergic rhinitis or drug allergy. Nevertheless, I think we need to rule out progression.      The prognosis of rrAML is poor.  The standard recommendation would be a clinical trial and he is a good candidate for a trial.  We should stain his blasts for CD123 to see if he qualifies for the TAGALONG study.  Off trial, we can consider a metronomic decitabine.  He has not received aza/ven in over 2 years.  His myeloid mutation panel may be a clue if he has a susceptible clone.      We did talk about end of life issues. He reiterated his belief that quality of life means remaining independent.  We also talked about Inova Mount Vernon Hospital and hospice.      PLAN:  1) Continue Ivosidenib  2) BM Biopsy (which should include CD123 staining)   3) Video visit in the next week.    4) If he develops worsening sinus sx, he should get a sinus CT.

Standard therapy: I would consider returning to a hypomethylating given the length of time since your last bout of aza.    We have been doing more metronomic decitabine.  This is once weekly decitabine (low doses) and once weekly venetoclax.  This regimen does cause the typical cytopenia. There is biologic justification for this regimen.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.  Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  He maintained this response for the next two years.     Unfortunately, his most recent marrow shows progression. The prognosis of rrAML is poor.

Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  He maintained this response for the next two years.     Unfortunately, his most recent marrow shows progression. The prognosis of rrAML is poor.  He would be a candidate for a clinical trial; however, he does not meet the requirements for most rrAML trials that require a higher blast count. It is just a matter of time.     Off trial, I would use metronomic decitabine.  The main reason to use this regimen is the lower risk of cytopenias. We talked about this regimen at length.  I did tell him that observation/BSC is reasonable.  He would like to proceed with therapy.     PLAN:   1) I will discuss his case at The Eye Surgery Center LLC  2) Unless we have a trial, we can start metronomic decitabine.

He would be a candidate for a clinical trial though his blast percentage may be under the thresholds for many clinical trials.  However, progression is a matter of time.     I discussed several possible treatments with Dr Reuben Likes and at Surgery Center Of Farmington LLC.  Our options are add azacitidine to New Hope, switch to metronomic dec, switch to Marriott-Slaterville, **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** or switch to olutasidenib.  There is little data for any of these approaches in this particular situation.  That said, given the size of the IDH1 clone and the low disease burden, we decided to go with olutasidenib.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.  Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After  2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  He maintained this response for the next two years.     Unfortunately, his most recent marrow shows progression. The prognosis of rrAML is poor.  He would be a candidate for a clinical trial though his blast percentage may be under the thresholds for many clinical trials.  However, progression is a matter of time.     I discussed several possible treatments with Dr Reuben Likes and at Nebraska Spine Hospital, LLC.  Our options are add azacitidine to Aspirus Langlade Hospital, switch to metronomic dec, switch to myelotarg, or switch to olutasidenib.  There is little data for any of these approaches in this particular situation.  That said, given the size of the IDH1 clone and the low disease burden, we decided to go with olutasidenib.

INTERPRETATION:  In this bone marrow sample from a patient with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the previously reported DNMT3A and IDH1 variants of clinical significance were again detected.  New variants in ETV6 and SETBP1 were also identified in this sample. The previously reported variants in NPM1, NRAS, and ZRSR2 were not detected to a sensitivity of 3% variant allele fraction (VAF) in this sample (see UJW11-91478, GN56213-Y8657).  These results are consistent with clonal evolution of this patient's leukemia. Clinicopathologic correlation is **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** recommended.    Descriptions of the variants are provided below.     Newly identified variants:        ETV6 c.1253G>C                           p.(Arg418Thr) [R418T] is a missense variant that alters the last nucleotide in exon 7.  This variant is predicted to alter normal splicing, and is likely to lead to loss or alteration of protein function.  Overall, ETV6 mutations are reported in 2% of AML (1,5).       SETBP1 c.2608G>A p.(Gly870Ser) [G870S] a missense mutation predicted to alter a single amino acid in exon 4. Mutations in SETBP1 are associated with secondary AML (7).  Of note, this variant was detected at a lower variant allele fraction (VAF), suggesting a subclonal alteration.    Previously identified variants:  DNMT3A c.2644C>T p.(Arg882Cys) [R882C] is one of several recurrent/hotspot mutations impacting codon 882. DNMT3A codon 882 mutations are identified in 15-20% of AMLs (5). However, the prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations in AML has been inconsistent in published studies to date (1).      IDH1 c.394C>G p.(Arg132Gly) [R132G] is a recurrent gain-of-function mutation which is predicted to change a single amino                           acid in the encoded protein. The prognostic impact of IDH1 mutations has been inconsistent in published studies to date (1). In the appropriate setting, the presence of an activating mutation in Shands Hospital is associated with response to ivosidenib (6).     ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  The following variants of uncertain clinical significance were identified and described below.    Variants of Unknown Clinical Significance:   Gene Coding Predicted Protein Variant allele fraction   ASXL1 c.210_212del p.(Leu70del) 47.7%     ASXL1 c.210_212del p.(Leu70del) is an in-frame deletion resulting in loss of a single amino acid. Because the functional significance of this change has not been established, it is classified as an ASCO/AMP/CAP Tier III variant (variant of unknown clinical significance) (8). This variant has rarely been reported in population databases and was detected at a variant allele fraction near 50%, suggesting a germline (inherited) origin in this patient. However, since this assay does                           not test normal tissue, we cannot exclude that this variant is somatic (acquired).  NOTE: This variant lies within exon 4 of the ASXL1 gene which was not included in  previous testing panels for this patient.

Specialty medication(s) to be sent: Hematology/Oncology: Rezlidhia    Non-specialty medications/supplies to be sent: none    Medications not needed at this time: none     Rezlidhia (olutasidenib)    The patient declined counseling on missed dose instructions, goals of therapy, side effects and monitoring parameters, warnings and precautions, and drug/food interactions because  He will be counseled in clinic on 06/25/24 . The information in the declined sections below are for informational purposes only and was not discussed with patient.     Medication & Administration   Dosage:   Acute myeloid leukemia, relapsed/refractory, IDH1-mutated: Oral: 150 mg twice daily (Ref) for a minimum of 6 months to allow for clinical response; continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until hematopoietic cell transplant.  Administration:   Administer at approximately the same time(s) each day; do not administer two doses within 8 hours.  Administer on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.   Swallow capsules whole; do not break, open, or chew.  Adherence/Missed dose instructions:   Take a missed dose as soon as you think about it.  If it is less than 8 hours until your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your normal time.  Do not take 2 doses at the same time or extra doses.  Goals of Therapy   Prevent disease progression    Side Effects & Monitoring Parameters   List common side effects:  Skin rash (24%)  Edema (18%)  Abdominal pain (18%)  Constipation (26%), diarrhea (20%)  Decreased appetite (16%), nausea (38%), stomatitis (23%), vomiting (17%)  Nervous system: Fatigue (?36%), headache (13%), malaise (?36%)  Neuromuscular & skeletal: Arthralgia (28%)  Cough (17%), dyspnea (24%)  Miscellaneous: Fever (24%)    The following side effects should be reported to the provider:  Signs of an allergic reaction, like rash; hives; itching; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin with or without fever; wheezing; tightness in the chest or throat; trouble breathing, swallowing, or talking; unusual hoarseness; or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat.  Signs of liver problems like dark urine, tiredness, decreased appetite, upset stomach or stomach pain, light-colored stools, throwing up, or yellow skin or eyes.  Signs of gallstones like sudden pain in the upper right belly area, right shoulder area, or between the shoulder blades; yellow skin or eyes; or fever with chills.  Signs of high blood pressure like very bad headache or dizziness, passing out, or change in eyesight.  Swelling.  Shortness of breath    Monitoring Parameters:  Isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation status (in blood or bone marrow).   CBC with differential w/serum chemistries and LFTs (baseline, at least once weekly x first 2 months, every other week x the third month, 1 x in the fourth month, and then every other month).   Monitor for signs/symptoms of differentiation syndrome (eg, leukocytosis, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates/pleuropericardial effusion, kidney injury, fever/pyrexia, edema, and/or weight gain);   Monitor hemodynamic status if differentiation syndrome occurs or is suspected.   Monitor frequently for clinical signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (eg, fatigue, anorexia, right  upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, and/or jaundice)    Pregnancy and Lactation   Based on animal embryo-fetal toxicity studies, in utero exposure to olutasidenib may cause fetal harm.  The European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines recommend referral to a facility with expertise in cancer during pregnancy and encourage a multidisciplinary team (obstetrician, neonatologist, oncology team) approach  Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer during therapy and for 2 weeks after the last olutasidenib dose.  Contraindications, Warnings, & Precautions   Differentiation syndrome: Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life-threatening or fatal. Symptoms included leukocytosis, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates/pleuropericardial effusion, kidney injury, fever/pyrexia, edema, and/or weight gain. Of patients who experienced differentiation syndrome, a majority recovered after management or after olutasidenib treatment interruption. The onset of differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 1 day and up to 18 months after olutasidenib initiation and has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis. Differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroids and/or hydroxyurea treatment. (SYMPTOMS: fever; cough; trouble breathing; weight gain; swelling of the arms, legs, and neck; build-up of excess fluid around the heart and lungs; low blood pressure; and kidney failure)  Hepatotoxicity: Olutasidenib may cause hepatotoxicity.  The median time to onset of hepatotoxicity in relapsed or refractory AML was 1.2 months (range: 1 day to 17.5 months) after olutasidenib initiation, and the median time to resolution was 12 days (range: 1 day to 17 months). The most common hepatotoxicities were elevations of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. Signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction include fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, and/or jaundice.  Drug/Food Interactions   Medication list reviewed in Epic. The patient was instructed to inform the care team before taking any new medications or supplements. No drug interactions identified.   Avoid use with:   CYP3A4 Inducers (Moderate): May decrease the serum concentration of Olutasidenib. Risk X: Avoid combination  CYP3A4 Inducers (Strong): May decrease the serum concentration of Olutasidenib. Risk X: Avoid combination  CYP3A4 Substrates (Narrow Therapeutic Index/Sensitive with Inducers): Olutasidenib may decrease the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (Narrow Therapeutic Index/Sensitive with Inducers). Management: Avoid use of olutasidenib with sensitive or narrow therapeutic index CYP3A4 substrates when possible. If concurrent use with olutasidenib is unavoidable, monitor closely for evidence of decreased concentrations of the CYP3A4 substrates. Risk D: Consider therapy modification    Storage, Handling Precautions, & Disposal   Store at room temperature in a dry place. Do not store in a bathroom.  Keep all drugs in a safe place. Keep all drugs out of the reach of children and pets.  Throw away unused or expired drugs. Do not flush down a toilet or pour down a drain unless you are told to do so.

Adherence: no adherence barriers identified    Assessment: Mr.Halliwell is a 32 y.o. male with AML starting treatment with olutasidenib today. He completed 13 cycles of aza/ven in 3/2022 after diagnosis in 1/2021. He relapsed in 4/2022 with a subclonal progression of NPM1 loss and presence of del(7q), a  poor prognostic indicator. He was then initiated on ivosidenib and has been overall tolerating therapy well for 2 years. Most recent BMBx from 6/4/2024 shows disease progression. Given poor prognosis of rrAML, disease progression, size of IDH1 clone, and low disease burden, he was started on olutasidenib and is s/p 2 weeks of therapy and tolerating well.    Plan:   1) AML  - Continue olutasidenib 150 mg PO twice daily on empty stomach  - Plan on once weekly lab checks (and CMP) for transfusions and monitoring for differentiation syndomre; no need for repeat EKGs  - RTC on 7/29 for provider visit    2) ID prophylaxis  - Continue valacyclovir 500 mg PO daily (was taking prn beforehand)  - If ANC drops to <0.5, start levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily and also consider azole antifungal prophylaxis for prolonged neutropenia    3) Supportive care  - ondansetron 8 mg PO q8h prn nausea (not needing)    4) Cardio  - Continue lisinopril 10 mg PO daily  - Continue nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually every 5 minutes prn chest pain      F/u:  Future Appointments   Date Time Provider Department Center   7/12/2024  1:00 PM ONCINF CHAIR 22 HONC3UCA TRIANGLE ORA   7/19/2024  1:00 PM ONCINF CHAIR 17 HONC3UCA TRIANGLE ORA   7/26/2024  1:00 PM ONCINF CHAIR 13 HONC3UCA TRIANGLE ORA   7/29/2024  1:00 PM ADULT ONC LAB UNCCALAB TRIANGLE ORA   7/29/2024  2:00 PM Leotis Pain, Prescilla Sours, MD HONC2UCA TRIANGLE ORA   8/2/2024  1:00 PM ONCINF CHAIR 14 HONC3UCA TRIANGLE ORA       I spent 10 minutes with Mr.Brostrom in direct patient care.

Phone Assessment: pt states that he started the rezlidhia three weeks ago and has been fine up until yesterday he began to feel a little fatigued.  Today he was out and about and felt more of the fatigue/malaise so he took a nap once he got home.  He now is running a fever of 100.4, has a light cough and a few muscle aches (although he worked out in the yard over the weekend and feels the muscle soreness if from that).  He has already sent his son to the store for at home covid tests.    Pt denies fluid retention, chest/lung pain or shortness of breath.  He states he has had no weight gain and has probably lost a little weight since starting the rezlidha.     Triage Recommendations: RN advised generally if temp is 100.4 or above, RN would advise going to ED, but since pt is being proactive and will administer the covid test as soon as son arrives with it, the RN advised calling Korea back in the morning to see if he is feeling better and find the results of the test.  Pt was educated on s/s that would indicated he needed to go to the ED tonight which include SOB, increasing muscle aches or increasing fever.  Pt states understanding and will call this RN back in the morning to discuss further            Approx time spent reviewing chart, calling pt and documentation of call:  16 min"

Patient Name: Irine Seal  Chief Complaint: Fever Immunocompromised        Patient Name: Irine Seal  Chief Complaint: Fever Immunocompromised            ED Clinical Impression     Final diagnoses:   Angioedema, initial encounter (Primary)           Medical Decision Making, Impression, ED Course, Assessment and Plan       -I have reviewed the outside/prior medical records including telephone encounter from yesterday, oncology/hematology note from 7/12.    -Imaging reviewed and interpreted by me showed CXR with no e/o infiltrate or effusion  -Laboratory workup reviewed by me demonstrates thrombocytopenia 237, and ANC 1700, weight loss account of 3.5, hemoglobin of 8.0  -Spoke with Dr. Laural Benes from hematology   -Patient/caregiver discussions: discussed with patient  -Social Determinants of health which significantly affected care: NA  -Indications for observation/admission (or consideration of observation/admission) and/or appropriateness for outpatient management: pending hematology recommendations.         Tydarius Minas is a 65 y.o. male with history below presenting ED today for evaluation of left-sided facial swelling that began early this morning. Not have associated stridor, shortness of breath, rash, G.I. or other systemic symptoms. Does not have ecchymosis or evidence of trauma. Did have fever yesterday but denies dental pain, sore throat. His hemodynamically stable.    Ddx includes angioedema from lisinopril use, localized hematoma due to minor trauma. Also considered possibility of adverse event related to chemotherapy. Lower suspicion for odontogenic infectious source and do not think he requires cross sectional imaging at this time given improvement. Will trial antihistamines, though distribution of symptoms and clinical history is not suggestive of histamine mediated angioedema and have higher suspicion for bradycardia and related causes such as ACE-I. Does not have family or personal history of prior angioedema episodes.       ED Course:   ED Course as of 07/17/24 1222   Wed Jul 17, 2024   1059 On reassessment, there has not been progression of his facial swelling. Swelling of the cheek has actually improved, though there is persistent swelling of the left lower lip. No tongue swelling or dysphonia.    1134 RPP negative for infection.      Discussed with Dr. Laural Benes from hematology and they discussed with pharmacy. This is not a well-known phenomenon with his oral chemo and they are not recommending any additional workup or changes to his regimen at this time. Given improvement and mild nature of symptoms here, would defer additional treatment in TX A. Discussed observation in the ED in hospital and patient strongly prefers discharge home. Given that his symptoms have improved here and he is remained afebrile with reassuring workup, this is reasonable. Had a very detailed discussion about return precautions including worsening swelling or dental pain, recurrent fever or any other concerning symptoms. He has follow-up with hematology and 48 hours. I discussed this plan with their team and they are in agreement and they are going to message his primary hematologist about today's visit.     History   History obtained from: Patient     Whitman Laplume is a 45 y.o. male with history of AML, HTN, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was present ED today for evaluation of facial swelling.

States that he may have slept on the left side of his face on his fist but denies significant trauma. Has put ice on the area and feels that it has improved. States that he awoke several times urinate in the middle of the night and did not notice until around 5 AM. Reports that fever to 100.4 yesterday associated with mild dry cough and myalgias and malaise. Denies sore throat, neck pain, dysphagia, voice changes. As not had shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting or nausea. Reports that he was at the wellness center with his wife several days ago but has otherwise not had any potential sick contacts. Has not had fever to his knowledge today. No facial paresthesias or weakness noted.     Reports a soft tissue injury to the right forearm when it scraped along the wooden railing which occurred last week. He is had a pressure dressing in place and using but has not noted any drainage or erythema surrounding the wound.    Denies new medications.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.  Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  He maintained this response for the next two years.     Unfortunately, his most recent marrow shows progression. The prognosis of rrAML is poor.  He would be a candidate for a clinical trial though his blast percentage may be under the thresholds for many clinical trials.  However, progression is a matter of time.     I discussed several possible treatments with Dr Reuben Likes and at Altru Hospital.  Our options are add azacitidine to Keno, switch to metronomic dec, switch to Trinity, **Note De-Identified via Obfuscation** or switch to olutasidenib.  There is little data for any of these approaches in this particular situation.  That said, given the size of the IDH1 clone and the low disease burden, we decided to go with olutasidenib.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.  Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  He maintained this response for the next two years.     He relapsed in June 2024.  At that time, there was an increase in the Center For Advanced Plastic Surgery Inc subclone, which also picked up SETBP1 and ETV1.  We did not have an open clinical trial at the time so he was started on olutasidenib.  He has had a good response.  He is transfusion independent.     More recently he has developed a number of symptoms including low grade fever, arthralgias, and myalgias. In  addition, he has had an increase in his creatinine that is secondary to decreased renal perfusion.  Importantly, these symptoms improved with discontinuation of the drug.  I suspect this is a grade 1 differentiation syndrome.      Management of differentiation syndrome include early intervention with decadron.  The drug should not be stopped unless patients develop hypoxia or renal failure.  Note the median time on dexamethasone is 12 days.      PLAN:   1) Labs/infusion on 8/02  2) In 4 weeks labs/provider  3) Continue olutasidenib  4) Dexamethasone 10 mg BID x 10 days; then begin to wean off the dexamethasone slowly over 2 weeks.   5) Stay hydrated    HEME HX:   1/02/21: Presents with fevers, malaise (x 1 week) and leukocytosis.

His myeloid mutation panel at that time showed IDH1 and  DNMT3A mutations and loss of NPM1 and NRAS.  His subclone did pick up a del(7q), which is a poor prognostic sign.  Given this subclonal progression, he was started with ivosidenib.  After 2 months of therapy, he has had a significant response with < 3% blasts and < 0.5% MRD+.  He maintained this response for the next two years.     He relapsed in June 2024.  At that time, there was an increase in the Kindred Hospital The Heights subclone, which also picked up SETBP1 and ETV1.  We did not have an open clinical trial at the time so he was started on olutasidenib.  He has had a good response.      Shortly after he started olutasidenib, he developed differentiation syndrome.  On 7/25/24 he was started on dexamethasone 10mg  PO q6h.  Fortunately he has responded well to this and hasn't had any fevers since starting.  His kidney function remains stable.  He is slightly more anemic with a hgb of 7.3 g/dL, but is relatively asymptomatic.  He is scheduled for transfusion on Friday and we will keep that appointment.    Will plan to decrease dex to BID dosing and taper over 3 weeks.  This plan was discussed with him and given in writing.  Steroid taper:  Decrease to 10mg  twice daily x 4 days  Decrease to 8mg  twice daily x 4 days  Decrease to 6mg  twice daily x 4 days  Decrease to 4mg  twice daily x 4 days  Decrease to 2mg  twice daily x 4 days    PLAN:   1) Labs/infusion on 8/02  2) Follow up with Dr. Zenaida Niece in about 3 weeks as scheduled  3) Continue olutasidenib  4) Dexamethasone taper as above  5) Stay hydrated    Markus Jarvis, RN, MSN, AGPCNP-C  Nurse Practitioner  Hematologic Malignancies  Desoto Regional Health System  7/29/2024    I personally spent 45 minutes face-to-face and non-face-to-face in the care of this patient, which includes all pre, intra, and post visit time on the date of service.

Patient's last known well was yesterday evening when he went to bed.  Per patient's family and EMS report, he woke up this morning at 8 AM with confusion and concern for vomiting and aspiration.  On EMS arrival, patient was noted to be alert however disoriented with very loud breath sounds and rhonchorous sounds in the lungs bilaterally.  He was also found to have left upper and lower extremity deficits.  Per the patient's son, he was with the patient all day yesterday and he was in his usual state of health which is alert and oriented with no neurologic deficits at baseline. Today's presentation is acute. His wife states that he has previously been on Eliquis, but has not been on the medication in recent years.    Reviewed patient's medical chart from 7/29/2024, currently receiving treatment for AML.    Medical Decision Making:    68 yo M patient with history of AML presents to the ED for evaluation as a Code Stroke. LKW 7/31 at 10:30PM. On initial presentation, he was found to have dysarthric speech with right lateral gaze deviation, 0/5 strength in left upper and lower extremity. Patient following commands on examination and was able to provide his name. Upon arrival in ED, patient was initially assess in resuscitation bay due to concerns for aspiration with hypoxia on arrival requiring 4L via Milbank. Breath sounds were present bilaterally, although rhonchi were auscultated throughout. After found to be acutely stable he was taken to CT scan. While in CT, he was able to get CT Noncontrast while laying flat, however, patient had significant desaturation to the 60s. Imaging was terminated at that point, and patient's head was quickly raised and placed on a nonrebreather. Due to concerns for aspiration and ongoing hypoxia, he was brought back to the resuscitation bay. I discussed with the patient's son and wife concerns at bedside regarding his presenting deficits as well as his hypoxia. They felt that it was within his wishes to remain Full Code at this point in time.    Patient was intubated for airway protection and hypoxia likely 2/2 aspiration of vomit vs sputum and taken back to CT after stabilization where he was found to have occlusions and evolving infarctions in right ACA, MCA, and PCA territories. His work up in the ED otherwise was remarkable for elevated troponin with non-ishcemic EKG, likely demand in setting of poor cerebral perfusion, bedside POCUS with possible identified ASD vs PFO although patient with need inpatient Echo for better characterization, and AKI. Unclear at this time etiology for his acute presentation, although underlying leukemia as well as history of atrial fibrillation certainly considered. Patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU and further care and management assumed by their team. Patient's family were updated frequently at bedside. Additionally reached out to the patient's oncologist on the request of the family to inform him of the patient's acute presentation.

LOS: 0 days      Assessment and Plan   Contact Information:  Family contact: Aldahir, Litaker (Son)  6474398837 (Mobile)   PCP: Pcp, None Per Patient    Assessment: Pedro Whiters is a 39 y.o. male with a past medical history of AML (on olutasidenib), , afib/flutter (not on eliquis), HTN  who was admitted to Children'S Hospital Of Alabama on 08/02/2024 for left hemiplegia, right gaze concerning for acute ischemic stroke.       # Ischemic stroke in the right ACA, MCA and PCA territory: Essex Endoscopy Center Of Nj LLC 2230 7/31. NIHSS was 11 on presentation to Castleview Hospital. Patient is outside of the tPA window and CTP, CTA head and neck was obtained as he is within 24 hr window. CTA head showed occlusion in R A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA. No intervention was done given no LVO. Possible etiology of his stroke includes cardioembolic given history of afib/aflutter, atheroembolic and arthrosclerosis.  He was admitted to NSICU for close monitoring.  Will complete stroke workup as below.    Workup:  Resulted:  - Non-contrasted CT scan of the head showed hypodensity in R frontal lobe and R occipital lobe region  -  CTA Neck , 08/16/2024, unremarkable   - CTA Head 08/06/2024, Evidence of thrombotic occlusions involving right A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA.   - CTP, 08/19/2024, 86.2 mL region of perfusion mismatch within the right ACA, MCA and PCA territories, with mismatch ratio of 2.6.     Pending:  - Hemoglobin A1c, fasting lipid panel  - A1c  - TTE    Plan:  - Hospitalize to NSICU for neuro/vitals checks  - BP: restart home hypertensive medications when cleared by speech, will allow brief episodes of blood pressure increases up to <220/120.  - Antithrombotic therapy with: aspirin 81 mg orally every day  - Additional brain imaging: Check MRI brain w/ COW protocol to evaluate for ischemic stroke  - Carotid artery imaging:  Obtained  - Per 2018 ACC/AHA Guidelines, plan to initiate moderate-intensity statin treatment (reduce LDL by 30-50%) as patient's age is > 75. Statin: Atorvastatin 40 mg  - PT, OT assessments  - Speech therapy for swallowing evaluation and cognition assessment  - Strict NPO until cleared by speech therapy or nursing bedside dysphagia screening - Case Management consult  - Provide stroke education for patient and family.  - Tobacco abuse: no  - Appropriate for clinical trial screening? No.    # Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, c/f aspiration pneumonia  Patient was found in bed with foaming in his mouth, possibility os aspiration event at home. Was satting 90% initially and acutely desaturated to 60% and the CT scan requiring intubation.  - Consider starting empiric antibiotics, per ICU     # Afib/flutter   Follow by Grandview Medical Center Cardiology, Dr. Zenaida Deed. Was not having symptomatic episodes for some time but had one symptomatic episode in January. Due to issues with bleeding, bruising, and thrombocytopenia with his AML in addition to very small burden of atrial fibrillation, they had made a mutual decision not to pursue Eliquis at this time.   - Consider cardiology consult to discuss risks and benefit of AC in the future     #  AML (relapsed in June 2024)  Follow by Dr. Leotis Pain. On olutasidenib. Notable for low platelets, 76 on admission, but improving since recent labs.   - Reach out to Dr. Leotis Pain.   - Continued home dexamethasone taper for differentiation syndrome (possible side effect from olutasidenib).     - Dexamethasone 10 mg BID x 10 days (started 7/24); then begin to wean off the dexamethasone slowly over 2 weeks.     Discharge Planning:   - Case management: consulted. Recommendations appreciated.  - Social work: N/A  - PT: consulted, TBD  - OT: consulted, TBD  - SLP: consulted, TBD  - Expected Discharge Disposition: TBD. Checklist:  - Diet: Strict NPO until patient passes bedside dysphagia screen or evaluation by speech-language pathology  - IV fluids: no  - Bowel Regimen: No indication for a bowel regimen at this time (reason: No concern for constipation)  - GI PPX: No GI indications  - DVT PPX: Lovenox 40 mg Luray daily  - Lines/Access: PIV x2.    - Foley: Yes. Insertion date 8/1. Reason for insertion unable to urinate on their own.    This patient was seen and discussed with Dr.  Regino Schultze , who agrees with the above assessment and plan.      This patient is co-managed with the NSICU Service. Under this co-management agreement, the NSICU serves as the first-call team. Please page the NSICU team at 678-272-5529 for any questions/concerns.  Neurology Team A resident can be reached at 928-830-1531.    Joaquim Lai, MD, PhD  PGY-2, Neurology      Attending physician attestation:  I saw the patient with the Resident. I discussed the findings, assessment and plan with the Resident and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the Resident's note.     The patient presented with symptoms of left-sided weakness/neglect and right gaze deviation. He was outside the window for IV thrombolytics. CTA head with perfusion study was obtained. CTA head did show a right ACA occlusion, though the perfusion map suggested that the right ACA territory was already infarcted. The patient also had an occlusion in the distal right MCA and right PCA, but these occlusions were not amenable to attempt thrombectomy. He was intubated prior to the CTA head study due to desaturations to 60% (likely secondary to aspiration). We will plan to obtain an MRI brain to assess the infarct burden, as well as a TTE to complete the stroke work-up. Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, he likely would benefit from being started on anticoagulation at some point in the near future, though we will plan to discuss this with his outpatient cardiologist.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:   # Ischemic stroke in the right ACA, MCA and PCA territory: Central Delaware Endoscopy Unit LLC 2230 7/31. NIHSS was 11 on presentation to Boston Endoscopy Center LLC. Patient is outside of the tPA window and CTP, CTA head and neck was obtained as he is within 24 hr window. CTA head showed occlusion in R A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA. No intervention was done given no LVO. Possible etiology given his stroke impacting multiple vessel vascular territories: hypercoagulable state secondary to AML, cardioembolic given history of afib/aflutter without AC, less likely explained by atheroembolic and arthrosclerosis alone given other possibilities and well controlled risk factors. Next steps pending GOC with family and ICU team.     Workup:  - Non-contrasted CT scan of the head showed hypodensity in R frontal lobe and R occipital lobe region  -  CTA Neck , 08/17/2024, unremarkable   - CTA Head 08/12/2024, Evidence of thrombotic occlusions involving right A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA.   - CTP, 08/08/2024, 86.2 mL region of perfusion mismatch within the right ACA, MCA and PCA territories, with mismatch ratio of 2.6.   - MRI Brain wwo: Evolving stroke involving the right ACA, MCA, and PCA territories. There are a couple of additional punctate infarcts in the left frontal and left occipital lobes.   - TTE final read pending, per prelim report, LVEF>55%  - fasting lipid panel wnl  - HbA1c 5     Plan:  - Follow up GOC 8/2  - Restart home hypertensive medications if blood pressure increases, will allow brief episodes of blood pressure increases up to <220/120.  - Antithrombotic therapy: aspirin 81 mg orally every day  - Atorvastatin 40 mg daily  - PT, OT assessments pending  - Speech therapy for swallowing evaluation and cognition assessment  -  Strict NPO until cleared by speech therapy  (after extubation)  - Case Management consulted  - Provide stroke education for patient and family.       # Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, c/f aspiration pneumonia  Patient was found in bed with foaming in his mouth, possibility os aspiration event at home. Was satting 90% initially and acutely desaturated to 60% during CT scan which necessitated intubation.  - Vent management/extubation plan per NSICU     # Afib/flutter   Follow by Chi St Alexius Health Turtle Lake Cardiology, Dr. Zenaida Deed. Was not having symptomatic episodes for some time but had one symptomatic episode in January, not currently symptomatic here. Due to issues with bleeding, bruising, and thrombocytopenia with his AML in addition to very small burden of atrial fibrillation, they had made a mutual decision not to pursue Eliquis at this time.   - Attempted to contact Dr. Zenaida Deed 8/2 to update him per family request, however he is out of the office/ unavailable to message    # T2MI  - elevated troponin on admission, now peaked  - Initial EKG without ST changes concerning for acute MI  - ECHO completed 8/1, LVEF >55%  - Consider cardiology consult if hemodynamic instability, worsening troponin elevation     # AML (relapsed in June 2024)  Follow by Dr. Leotis Pain. On olutasidenib. Notable for low platelets, 76 on admission, now 58, but improving since recent labs OP. CBC otherwise relatively consistent with pre-admission.    - Dr. Leotis Pain aware of patient status  - Per heme/onc consult:  - Hold his AML treatment (olutasidenib) while intubated as medication cannot be crushed.   - Currently delaying (and will discontinue pending comfort care initiation) dexamethasone taper for differentiation syndrome (possible side effect from olutasidenib):  1. Decrease to 10mg  twice daily through 8/2/24  2. Decrease to 8mg  twice daily x 4 days on 8/3/24  3. Decrease to 6mg  twice daily x 4 days  4. Decrease to 4mg  twice daily x 4 days  5.

Malignant hematology was consulted for recommendations on AML therapy management.     AML  Diagnosed 1/2021 and completed 13 cycles of aza/ven and then relapsed 4/2022 and was transitioned to ivosidenib and archived remission 6/2022. Relapsed 6/2024 and initiated olutasidenib with a reasonably good response, but remained transfusion dependent. Last seen in oncology clinic on 7/29/24.     Recommendations:   - Hold his AML treatment (olutasidenib) while intubated as medication cannot be crushed.   - Continue Dexamethasone 10mg  twice daily, we can delay taper until his prognosis is clearer.     This patient has been staffed with Dr. Laurian Brim. These recommendations were discussed with the primary team.

Imaging was reviewed with family. Long term consequences of his stroke include difficulties with executive function, decreased vision in his bilateral left visual fields, and decreased visual-spatial awareness.   - Family stated patient had recently had a conversation regarding nursing homes and long-term care in the event of a stroke. Family confident patient would not want to reside in a nursing home or require long-term ventilation and nutrition if he were to be left with significant deficits.  - Discussion of comfort focused care options presented. Family feel further transport would not be in his best interest and are opting for compassionate extubation in the following days after making some initial arrangements and taking some time to say their goodbye's.     Communication of Treatment Decisions   - Family opting for in-hospital compassionate extubation this weekend.  - Family opting to make patient DNR given his significant stroke.

LOS: 2 days      Overnight Events & Subjective:     - NAEON. On PRCV overnight and transitioned to PCV.  - Per GOC 8/2, family opting for in-hospital compassionate extubation and transitioned patient to DNR given significant stroke. Per son, family will plan to come to bedside together 8/4 with hopes to consider transition to comfort afterwards.  - Family provided living will, reportedly scanned into chart.     Physical Exam:     General Exam: (on Morphine 8 mg/hr)  General Appearance:Intubated, minimally responsive.  HEENT: Head is atraumatic and normocephalic. Sclera anicteric without injection.    Neurological Exam:  Mental Status: Patient remains asleep, not opening eyes to noxious or following commands. However, will move RUE and RLE with stimulation as above. Not following commands.   Cranial Nerves: Pupils 3mm bilaterally with equal, sluggish reaction to 2mm bilaterally. Oculocephalic reflex is present and intact.   Motor Exam: RUE/RLE antigravity, spontaneously moving, LUE 0/5, LLE 0-1/5  Reflexes: Toes are downgoing on the right, upgoing on the left. Patellar 1+ bilaterally. Unable to assess upper extremity reflexes secondary to several current and prior access points.  Sensory:  Deferred     Cerebellar/Coordination/Gait: Unable to assess due to mental status.secondary to intubation and sedation       Assessment/Plan:       Assessment: Uriel Dowding is a 71 y.o. male with a past medical history of AML (on olutasidenib), afib/flutter (not on eliquis), HTN who was admitted to Gulf Coast Outpatient Surgery Center LLC Dba Gulf Coast Outpatient Surgery Center on 08/28/2024 for left hemiplegia, right gaze concerning for acute ischemic stroke.       ACTIVE PROBLEMS:  #Ischemic stroke in the right ACA, MCA and PCA territory: Thedacare Medical Center - Waupaca Inc 2230 7/31. NIHSS was 11 on presentation to Ophthalmology Ltd Eye Surgery Center LLC. Patient is outside of the tPA window and CTP, CTA head and neck was obtained as he is within 24 hr window. CTA head showed occlusion in R A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA. No intervention was done given no LVO. Possible etiology given his stroke impacting multiple vessel vascular territories: hypercoagulable state secondary to AML, cardioembolic given history of afib/aflutter without AC, less likely explained by atheroembolic and arthrosclerosis alone given other possibilities and well controlled risk factors. Per GOC 8/2 (see ACP note), plan to allow family time to visit patient before transitioning to comfort measures.     Workup:  - Non-contrasted CT scan of the head showed hypodensity in R frontal lobe and R occipital lobe region  -  CTA Neck , 08/28/2024, unremarkable   - CTA Head 08/11/2024, Evidence of thrombotic occlusions involving right A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA.   - CTP, 08/09/2024, 86.2 mL region of perfusion mismatch within the right ACA, MCA and PCA territories, with mismatch ratio of 2.6.   - MRI Brain wwo: Evolving stroke involving the right ACA, MCA, and PCA territories. There are a couple of additional punctate infarcts in the left frontal and left occipital lobes.   - TTE, LVEF>55% without evidence of shunt  - fasting lipid panel wnl  - HbA1c 5     Plan:  - Hold aspirin 81 mg, Atorvastatin 40 mg given comfort focused measures  - Tentative plan for compassionate extubation 8/4 pending family  decision  - Morphine gtt     # Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, c/f aspiration pneumonia s/p ETT  Patient was found in bed with foaming in his mouth, possibility os aspiration event at home. Was satting 90% initially and acutely desaturated to 60% during CT scan which necessitated intubation.  - Tentative plan for compassionate extubation 8/4 pending family decision     # Afib/flutter   Follow by Va Hudson Valley Healthcare System Cardiology, Dr. Zenaida Deed. Was not having symptomatic episodes for some time but had one symptomatic episode in January, not currently symptomatic here. Due to issues with bleeding, bruising, and thrombocytopenia with his AML in addition to very small burden of atrial fibrillation, they had made a mutual decision not to pursue Eliquis at this time.   - Attempted to contact Dr. Zenaida Deed 8/2 to update him per family request, however he is out of the office/ unavailable to message     # AML (relapsed in June 2024)  Follow by Dr. Leotis Pain. On olutasidenib. Notable for low platelets, 76 on admission, now 58, but improving since recent labs OP. CBC otherwise relatively consistent with pre-admission. Will continue steroids per ICU team despite GOC 8/2 for comfort measures while family waiting to visit patient.  - Dr. Leotis Pain aware of patient status  - Per heme/onc consult:  - Hold his AML treatment (olutasidenib) while intubated as medication cannot be crushed.   - Currently delaying (and will discontinue pending comfort care initiation) dexamethasone taper for differentiation syndrome (possible side effect from olutasidenib):  - Continuing dexamethasone 10 mg Q12H for now      # Discharge Planning:   - Case management: pending.  - Social work: N/A  - PT: consulted, TBD  - OT: consulted, TBD  - SLP: consulted, TBD  - PM&R:  TBD  - Expected Discharge Disposition: TBD.  Facility: TBD  - Follow-up appointments with TBD.     # Checklist:  - Diet: NPO  - IV fluids: no  - Bowel Regimen: No indication for a bowel regimen at this time (reason: no report of constipation, will ctm)  - GI PPX: H2 blocker  - DVT PPX: DVT chemoprophylaxis contraindicated due to thrombocytopenia/bleeding risk  - Lines/Access:  NG tube and PIV x2.    - Foley: Yes.

LOS: 3 days      Overnight Events & Subjective:     Remains intubated, pending compassionate extubation and comfort care.  Morphine drip increased this morning.     Physical Exam:     General Exam: (on Morphine 10 mg/hr)  General Appearance:Intubated, minimally responsive.  HEENT: Head is atraumatic and normocephalic. Sclera anicteric without injection.    Neurological Exam:  Mental Status: Patient remains asleep, not opening eyes to voice (no noxious) or following commands. However, will move RUE and RLE with stimulation as above. Not following commands.   Cranial Nerves: Pupils 3mm bilaterally with equal, sluggish reaction to 2mm bilaterally. Oculocephalic reflex is present and intact.

Sensory:  Deferred     Cerebellar/Coordination/Gait: Unable to assess due to mental status.secondary to intubation and sedation       Assessment/Plan:       Assessment: Deray Dawes is a 46 y.o. male with a past medical history of AML (on olutasidenib), afib/flutter (not on eliquis), HTN who was admitted to Va North Florida/South Georgia Healthcare System - Gainesville on 08/06/2024 for left hemiplegia, right gaze concerning for acute ischemic stroke.       ACTIVE PROBLEMS:  #Ischemic stroke in the right ACA, MCA and PCA territory: Genesis Medical Center-Dewitt 2230 7/31. NIHSS was 11 on presentation to Rockledge Fl Endoscopy Asc LLC. Patient is outside of the tPA window and CTP, CTA head and neck was obtained as he is within 24 hr window. CTA head showed occlusion in R A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA. No intervention was done given no LVO. Possible etiology given his stroke impacting multiple vessel vascular territories: hypercoagulable state secondary to AML, cardioembolic given history of afib/aflutter without AC, less likely explained by atheroembolic and arthrosclerosis alone given other possibilities and well controlled risk factors. Per GOC 8/2 (see ACP note), plan to allow family time to visit patient before transitioning to comfort measures.     Workup:  - Non-contrasted CT scan of the head showed hypodensity in R frontal lobe and R occipital lobe region  -  CTA Neck , 08/09/2024, unremarkable   - CTA Head 08/09/2024, Evidence of thrombotic occlusions involving right A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA.   - CTP, 08/02/2024, 86.2 mL region of perfusion mismatch within the right ACA, MCA and PCA territories, with mismatch ratio of 2.6.   - MRI Brain wwo: Evolving stroke involving the right ACA, MCA, and PCA territories. There are a couple of additional punctate infarcts in the left frontal and left occipital lobes.   - TTE, LVEF>55% without evidence of shunt  - fasting lipid panel wnl  - HbA1c 5     Plan:  - Hold aspirin 81 mg, Atorvastatin 40 mg given comfort focused measures  - Plan for compassionate extubation 8/4    - Morphine gtt     # Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, c/f aspiration pneumonia s/p ETT  Patient was found in bed with foaming in his mouth, possibility os aspiration  event at home. Was satting 90% initially and acutely desaturated to 60% during CT scan which necessitated intubation.  - Extubation 8/4      # Afib/flutter   Follow by Olympic Medical Center Cardiology, Dr. Zenaida Deed. Was not having symptomatic episodes for some time but had one symptomatic episode in January, not currently symptomatic here. Due to issues with bleeding, bruising, and thrombocytopenia with his AML in addition to very small burden of atrial fibrillation, they had made a mutual decision not to pursue Eliquis at this time.   - Attempted to contact Dr. Zenaida Deed 8/2 to update him per family request, however he is out of the office/ unavailable to message     # AML (relapsed in June 2024)  Follow by Dr. Leotis Pain. On olutasidenib. Notable for low platelets, 76 on admission, now 58, but improving since recent labs OP. CBC otherwise relatively consistent with pre-admission. Will continue steroids per ICU team despite GOC 8/2 for comfort measures while family waiting to visit patient.  - Dr. Leotis Pain aware of patient status  - Per heme/onc consult:  - Hold his AML treatment (olutasidenib) while intubated as medication cannot be crushed.   - Continue Dexamethasone 10 mg BID for differentiation syndrome (possible side effect from olutasidenib):      # Discharge Planning:   - Case management: pending.  - Social work: N/A  - PT: N/A  - OT: N/A  - SLP: N/A  - PM&R:  TBD  - Expected Discharge Disposition: TBD.  Facility: TBD  - Follow-up appointments with TBD.     # Checklist:  - Diet: NPO  - IV fluids: no  - Bowel Regimen: No indication for a bowel regimen at this time (reason: no report of constipation, will ctm)  - GI PPX: H2 blocker  - DVT PPX: Holding due to comfort measures  - Lines/Access:  NG tube and PIV x2.    - Foley: Yes.

Assessment/Plan:     Assessment: Nasier Closs is a 59 y.o. male with a past medical history of AML (on olutasidenib), afib/flutter (not on eliquis), HTN who was admitted to Community Health Network Rehabilitation South on 08/28/2024 for left hemiplegia, right gaze concerning for acute ischemic stroke. Now s/p extubation to comfort care.    ACTIVE PROBLEMS:  #Ischemic stroke in the right ACA, MCA and PCA territory  University Of Washington Medical Center 2230 7/31. NIHSS was 11 on presentation to Baylor Scott & White Medical Center At Waxahachie. Patient is outside of the tPA window and CTP, CTA head and neck was obtained as he is within 24 hr window. CTA head showed occlusion in R A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA. No intervention was done given no LVO. Possible etiology given his stroke impacting multiple vessel vascular territories: hypercoagulable state secondary to AML, cardioembolic given history of afib/aflutter without AC, less likely explained by atheroembolic and arthrosclerosis alone given other possibilities and well controlled risk factors. Per GOC 8/2 (see ACP note), patient was extubated 8/4 to comfort care.     Workup:  - Non-contrasted CT scan of the head showed hypodensity in R frontal lobe and R occipital lobe region  -  CTA Neck , 08/14/2024, unremarkable   - CTA Head 08/14/2024, Evidence of thrombotic occlusions involving right A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA.   - CTP, 08/23/2024, 86.2 mL region of perfusion mismatch within the right ACA, MCA and PCA territories, with mismatch ratio of 2.6.   - MRI Brain wwo: Evolving stroke involving the right ACA, MCA, and PCA territories. There are a couple of additional punctate infarcts in the left frontal and left occipital lobes.   - TTE, LVEF>55% without evidence of shunt  - fasting lipid panel wnl  - HbA1c 5     Plan:  - Hold aspirin 81 mg, Atorvastatin 40 mg given comfort focused measures  - Morphine PCA (Infusion 12 mg/hr, Bolus 0 mg, Lockout 10 minutes)     # Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, c/f aspiration pneumonia s/p ETT s/p Extubation 8/4  Patient was found in bed with foaming in his mouth, possibility os aspiration event at home. Was satting 90% initially and acutely desaturated to 60% during CT scan which necessitated intubation. Now s/p extubation 8/4 to comfort care. Will continue morphine PCA for any potential air hunger.  - Morphine PCA (Infusion 12 mg/hr, Bolus 0 mg, Lockout 10 minutes)     #Hx Afib/flutter   Follow by Riverwalk Surgery Center Cardiology, Dr. Zenaida Deed. Was not having symptomatic episodes for some time but had one symptomatic episode in January, not currently symptomatic here (low afib burden). Due to issues with bleeding, bruising, and thrombocytopenia with his AML in addition to very small burden of atrial fibrillation, they had made a mutual decision not to pursue Eliquis at that time. Attempted to contact Dr. Zenaida Deed 8/2 to update him per family request, however he is out of the office/ unavailable to message. As patient was transitioned to comfort care 8/5, have deferred treatment of Afib/flutter, focusing on symptomatic treatment as above.     # AML (relapsed in June 2024)  Follow by Dr. Leotis Pain. On olutasidenib. Notable for low platelets, 76 on admission, now 58, but improving since recent labs OP. CBC otherwise relatively consistent with pre-admission, though labs stopped trending since transition to comfort care 8/4 after extubation. Will continue steroids per ICU team and Hematology despite GOC 8/2 for comfort measures only given previous concern for differentiation syndrome.  - Dr. Leotis Pain aware of patient status  - Per heme/onc consult:  - Hold his AML treatment (olutasidenib) while intubated as medication cannot be crushed.   - Continue Dexamethasone 10 mg BID for differentiation syndrome (possible side effect from olutasidenib):      # Discharge Planning:   - Case management: pending.  - Social work: N/A  - PT: N/A  - OT: N/A  - SLP: N/A  - PM&R:  TBD  - Expected Discharge Disposition: TBD.

Pending Test Results: n/a      Hospital Course:   ERICH RICKE is a 69 y.o. male with a pertinent past medical history of acute myeloid leukemia, atrial fibrillation flutter (not on anticoagulation), HTN , who presented with left hemiplegia and right gaze deviation and was found to have right ACA/MCA/PCA infarcts. CTA head showed occlusion in R A1, arterial branches of superior division of right MCA, and posterior P2 segment of right PCA. No intervention was done given no LVO. Possible etiology given his stroke impacting multiple vessel vascular territories: hypercoagulable state secondary to AML, cardioembolic given history of afib/aflutter without AC, less likely explained by atheroembolic and arthrosclerosis alone given other possibilities and well controlled risk factors. In discussion with family, patient had recently had a conversation regarding nursing homes and long-term care in the event of a stroke. Family was confident that patient would not want to reside in a nursing home or require long-term ventilation and nutrition if he were to be left with significant deficits. Family opted for in-hospital compassionate extubation and transition to comfort care.      Maebelle Munroe was pronounced dead at 4:29 pm on 08/10/2024.
