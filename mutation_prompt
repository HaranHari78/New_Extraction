def mutation_extraction_prompt(text: str):
    return f"""
You are a medical language model trained to extract structured clinical data from patient notes.

From the clinical note below, extract **mutation status** information for the following genes:
- NPM1, TP53, FLT3, ASXL1

Look specifically for phrases indicating:
- Whether the gene is **mutated**, **wild type**, **not mutated**, **positive**, or **negative**
- Also capture **date of test** if mentioned
- Always include the **exact sentence** as evidence

ðŸ“Œ Important:
- If a gene is only mentioned but **no status** is given (like mutated or wild type), leave "status" as empty string but still return the sentence.
- Be strict: only classify a gene as mutated/wild type if itâ€™s clearly stated.

Return output in the following JSON format:

{{
  "document_title": "",
  "mutational_status": {{
    "NPM1": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "TP53": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "FLT3": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}},
    "ASXL1": {{"status": "", "date": "", "evidence": ""}}
  }}
}}
