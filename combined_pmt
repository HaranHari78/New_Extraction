def build_genetic_mutation_prompt(text: str, doc_title: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are a medical language model trained to extract structured genetic mutation data from clinical notes.

Please analyze the input text and extract gene mutations that meet **all** of the following criteria:

✅ Mutation must be:
- Explicitly stated as **positive**, **present**, **detected**, or **found**
- Related to a specific **gene name** (e.g., FLT3, NPM1, TP53, ASXL1)
- Supported by the **exact evidence sentence** (copied exactly from the input)
- Include the **document title**: "{doc_title}"

❌ Do NOT include:
- Genes marked as **negative**, **absent**, or **not detected**
- Summarized or inferred data
- Incomplete records (missing any of the 4 required fields)

---

💡 Examples of valid evidence:
- "Genomic analysis shows FLT3 mutation is positive."
- "NPM1 was detected in the genetic test."
- "TP53 mutation was found on sequencing."

---

📤 Output Format (JSON only):
{{
  "genetic_mutations": [
    {{
      "gene": "<GENE_NAME>",
      "presence": "positive",
      "docu_title": "{doc_title}",
      "evidence_sentence": "<EXACT_SENTENCE_FROM_NOTE>"
    }}
  ]
}}

Only include entries that are explicitly stated and complete.

def build_performance_status_prompt(text: str, doc_title: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are a medical language model trained to extract structured **Performance Status** data from clinical notes.

Please analyze the input text and extract **ECOG** or **KPS** performance scores that meet **all** of the following criteria:

✅ The extracted score must be:
- Clearly stated in the form of **ECOG** (0–5) or **KPS** (0–100)
- Supported by the **exact evidence sentence** (copied verbatim)
- Paired with the **document title**: "{doc_title}"

❌ Do NOT include:
- Inferred scores (like “seems poor” without a numeric score)
- Mentions without clear ECOG/KPS values
- Incomplete entries (missing score or evidence)

---

💡 Valid evidence examples:
- "Patient has ECOG performance status of 2."
- "Karnofsky score recorded as 80 during last visit."
- "ECOG: 1 on admission, patient was ambulatory."

📤 Output Format (JSON only):
{{
  "performance_status": [
    {{
      "score_type": "ECOG",
      "value": "<ECOG_VALUE>",
