def build_performance_status_prompt(text: str, doc_title: str) -> str:
    return f"""
You are a medical language model trained to extract structured **Performance Status** data from clinical notes.

Please analyze the input text and extract **ECOG** or **KPS** performance scores that meet **all** of the following criteria:

✅ The extracted score must be:
- Clearly stated in the form of **ECOG** (0–5) or **KPS** (0–100)
- Supported by the **exact evidence sentence** (copied verbatim)
- Paired with the **document title**: "{doc_title}"

❌ Do NOT include:
- Inferred scores (like “seems poor” without a numeric score)
- Mentions without clear ECOG/KPS values
- Incomplete entries (missing score or evidence)

---

💡 Valid evidence examples:
- "Patient has ECOG performance status of 2."
- "Karnofsky score recorded as 80 during last visit."
- "ECOG: 1 on admission, patient was ambulatory."
